text_files/Thenextoutbreak_We’renotready_BillGates.txt,"i was a kid the disaster word about most was a nuclear war that's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement filled with cans of food and water when the nuclear attack came we were supposed to go down stairs hunker down and eat out of that barrel to day the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this instead it looks like this if anything chills over ten million people in the next few decades it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war not missiles but my crops now par the reason for this is that we have invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrence but we've actually invested very little in a system to stop and at the demi were not ready for the next epidemic let's look at a bola i'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper a lots of touchantes i fall with it a carefully through the case analysis tools we used to track pollio a radiation and as you look at what went on the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough the problem is that we didn't have a system at all in fact there are some pretty obvious i keen missing pieces we didn't have a group of epidemiologist ready to go who would have gone seem what the disease was he how parted spread a the case reports came in on paper i was buried delayed before they were put on line and they were extremely inaccurate we didn't have a medical team ready to go but didn't have a way preparing people now medicine saponies did a great job orchestrating volunteers but even so we were barslow than we should have been getting the thousands of workers in these countries and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers there was no one there to look at treatment approaches no one to look at the diagnostics no one define out what tools should be used as an example a we could have taken the blood of survivors process it and put that plasma back and people to protect them but that was never tried so there was a lot that was missing and these things are really a global failure the who is tuned to monitor epidemics but not to do these things i talked about now the movies it's quite different there's a group of hansom epidemiologist ready to go they move in they saved the day but that's just pure hollywood the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than a bola let's look at the progression of a bola over the year about ten thousand people died and nearly all were in the three best african countries there three reasons wide in spread more the first is there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers they found the people and they prevented more infections the second is the nature of the virus he bolides not spread through the air and by the time your contagious most people are so sick that their bedreddin didn't get into many urban areas and that was just luck if it got into a lot more binaries that case numbers would have been much larger so next time we might not be so lucky as you can have a virus where people feel well enough while the infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market the source of ours could be natural at aemilia bulwork could be by a terrorism and so they are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse in fact let's look at a mare of the virus as spread through the air a like the spanish flew back in nineteen eighteen so here's what would happen it would spread throughout the world very very quickly and you can see there's over thirty million people by from that epidemic so this is a serious problem we should be concerned but in fact we can build a really good response system we have the benefits of all the science and technology that we pocket here we've got cellphones to get information from the public and get information out to them we have satellite maps were concealer people are and where they're moving we have advances and by all ate their should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a path of generale to make drugs and back scenes that fit for that a passage so we could and tools but those tools be to be put into an overall lilloise and we need preparedness the best lessons i think on how to get prepared or again what we do for war for soldiers we have full time waiting to go we have reserves that can scale a settler numbers a nato has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly nato does a lot of war games to check or people well trained to the understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies so they are absolutely ready to go so those are the kinds of things we need to deals in epidemic a what are the key pieces of first is we need strong healest in poor countries that's where a mother's can get birthday kids to get all their back scenes but also where will see the outbreak very early on we need a medical reserve corps lots of people who have not the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise and then we need to pare those medical people with the military taking advantage of the military ability to move fast through the chests and scurries we to do simulations germ games not war games so that we see where the holes are the last time a germ game was found in the united states was back in two thousand one and it in goes so well so to the scores germs on people zero finally we need lots of advance or indeed and areas of vaccines and diagnostics there are some big breakthrough like the denotation by us the could work very very quickly i don't have an exact budget for what this would cost but i'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm the world may guasimas that if we have a world wide blew up adamic bidwell will go down by a re three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and minims of death these investments offer significant benefits on dispread for the epidemic the primary health care the andes those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe so i think this should absolutely be a priority there's only de panic we don't have to ford cans and the getter go down into the basement but we need to get going because time is not on our side in fact if there's one positing that can come out of the bolt epidemic it's that it concerned as a ferly warning a wake up call to get ready if we start now we can be ready for the next epidemic thank you

text_files/input_144_3.txt,"i class so to day all be talking about climate change and species responses to climate change and were all be shown you to day is what we can learn from the geological record in terms understanding pass fanatic events now species responded to those climatic events all right so the first context here in his cane you electricity itself which i'm not going to go into right now is a point that the world is warming and a human torsonse for it this been a law debate about this in the public media that i gain what hit the point that scientists are unified in a man that evidence is overwhelming at this point that the world is warming in human are sponsible so you look you look at the plot there you can sit a black line which shows historical observations of global mean temperatures over the last century you considers been about a seven tessier warming now if you look to the future which is those various blue lines you can see that the various models projects an acceleration of these warming trends over this century and depending on the scenario look at from blue to red there began anywhere from but a tottering to but a forebearing now he can nor that yellow red line of the bottom there that's more a one of scenery if we weren't to do the priest down hot and other greenhouse gassion the mediately what happened to climates and which is clearly knocking to happen any time soon so the point being that were facing a teterree warming over the century and a question that being what will happen how ill fiscal systems respond to a hurricane frequency flood frequency how will species and natural consistence response and how our own societies responded i take this drastic changes in climate so one place we can learn to look to the fire an ter these sort of questions is looking to the last twenty thousand years a pill if you look at that map of its top which you can see there is that twenty thousand years ago we had a large ice sheet on top of the northern hemisphere covering much of north america and the rest of northern hemisphere contract with a map and right there which shows an ice which is more the present day state i speak and my men to greenland we've gone from a glacial state to an irrigatin state in a span of a twenty thousand years that red carven thought him those that we've gone from a butter tendered change in greenland is in this temperature record from reeling we go from about at left twenty thousand years ago to write present day in a fessel abrupt warming and cooling along the wages abrupt transitional events and to have a very good delagoa record an understanding of the climatic change the past as now i look at the ecologists is to those connecticut so what does some of the things we can pull out from a sort of sort of data or we look at fossil paul and other plant records one of the things we can see is as species are highly dynamic as climate changes species migrate it is you can see the here where you can see the top there you can it's the left hand panel is for twenty one thousand years ago going to the right at present and i can see ice melts away as go from matama there but they look at the green which is a distresses based upon fossil poland other fossil plants records i could see the distress changed from being malignant us to oberos candid or the span of his twenty thousand years so ranges a highly dynamic now of course trees aren't taking up and moving than at walking from point of point be but instead there dispersing seeds on these seas established a new areas they can call nientes new populations and in other areas were with spruce used to grow those are is become unfavorable in those populations die off that's owes range ships of these species now a piece of good news majolica record is that we don't have very many observing tensions of plants of the last twenty thousand years plastics i should stand what example where we do is shown here in this diagram this is a some cross sections of some spruces there as the first four eight though the air from it from a still living species of spruce eager from extinct dishes of spruce and we so either some clear evidence from fossil records the laelia that as a satisfactum grew in the path it or not dounia so species do go extinct but bismarckian in the rule however if you combine climate change with other drivers other stresses to these natural systems that's what you can have widespread and potentially devastating of ways extinctions the most famous one occurrin to an end of the place to see in here with the extinction of madness and other large mammals from north america these were caused by the concomitant of climate change with human hunting renatus clinical i killed the man this wasn't as human hunting alone killed the males by his was a commision together that was so so deadly so on the clear lessons for to day is that as he go to the in his twenty per century it's a commision of climate change with human land use which changes it to nutrients slices with a basis spaces being moved from content etonnent that in a post a true risks to species at present the last point i want to hit is is the toy for century warming a big deal three o five digresses what's the big deal about that or the this plot makes it places said the twenty per century warm in a contact of what we've seen in the geological record though the horizontal axis is rate of change a bird laces his magnitude of change the point one a draw your technos at the red alibis what's projected for the twins century the green lines are brasilia of ten and the point there is that the twenty percent warming is unusual because its both got the highest rate of change and a largest magnitude chances of this definite reason in this delaine to be concerned about was coming for the century thank

in the group of numbers suppose the a a grup of numbers there that number would of numbers as to be the replace a single number that simpler we can call this sentence that is a single member to descry the character success a set of tea some of the entreaty which were going to see in this electric arithmetic mean white men median or sent in the dispersion we had going to talk about the scenes coaches ranged in the courtenays variants standards cold and coehorn fortune the first entered tendency arithmetic men commonly it is cares the mean it is the average of a group of numbers it is of lianor interval and resulted this point is very important it is not open for nominal and argentata it is affected by each value in the detest including extreme value one of the problem of the themes the disaffected by the extreme values computer by some in all values in the detached and dividing the sum by the number of values in the detached to heraus tentation new me means capital etes mute a present mean for the population the polizei my exeat is expenses extra rose three and so on placeant dewey ye here and is the number of elements for example the values are tonty four thirteen nineteen two de six eleven hard this numbers and durbeyfield because they are filaments so i difetti eighteen point six is the mean of the this fiume so now the etymon six can be replaced by this at a fibers okay suppose they class it is the average sixty so the whole march of the all the students can be the personal be a single lambeth the sixty six to me do an idea about deeper for ane of the whole

of the frequency so for this kind of group data the means for the tree now will go to the next to sentinence that is water some time if he look at the trivial that each values as given equal at i suppose it is not doubly the case they may be somewhat there some values where the bebita so for that cause you to go for waterism time i see this is to have it in a burberry went to a saint more importance are we to some of the numbers the average merit badoura so the water over its some of the product of watts and the value erasofines were existential and tables beaten to the data will the

deridingly there and there by how the orbital us or hinted towards the lean that jimsy and anderson been for an thing is the extent of which leanin octahedral case is interesting hates extends to fish the trial interacting oman that is going to be for nine of the taine there the others all is going to be higher appeared to them at a trial for a legitimate a complex you have a mill for a manse sammie samegabashi else occidistis teams tetrahedral that this debilitating oldest plating is always going to be less how less it is for nine times there is a detonator nine in coming from you taties to her to tartines to her to tarletane of lean six times to telling for and not to her dupotet and yell of approach how it is come okay anyway that's what i was trying to tell all tetrahedron on places and high speed because the setting is less and i stood otter had volunteering to completely difference in early deputies nor is it up here he not easy okay he lore did do up that's all you letlow let's not so i do see now you look at this halloween sing twenty thousand twenty five houdancour this delta bentotte here there that if i realise alas very small in them if you know who bet and look at the corresponding they say of the head all complex you'll be able to see that this is no i didn't i did win it i say you fell now compare the tablet or a herald between atalanta head if it is dilatorily little are not talking if in one leon in the octahedron the blue line in for of the heron legacies and er and diplomats do moro electrons so if you are a one lesson it is going to be in pity one part of the head delicate it is going to be in for if you are to one far less for it is going to be ponatah dike or point a delay we are talking for dice then in the home if it is she it is tell or one point to dilate similarly you can start footing for the trade they tried a lie no one not the one i do you an is going to be fixed six belaif that six does the for you multiply by four nine of detail with that for nine tom you'll be able to see that this is that califerne this plant actually make complete sense pioneers if we are talking all i spinosism the adaiel were comparing

text_files/input_144_1.txt,"h m what people think about a college they often think about national geographic they think about exotic places like propane forests they think about a charismatic animals like lions and tigers but really you can learn just as much if not more about ecology by looking at very mundane things like this in the agricultural fields of wisconsin a sisa family portrait of papists a mother and her offspring am there feeding at the tip of an a house now you might gather from the name perpetui on peas but they also feed on beans clover and of course i'll sell for him they have mouth parts but a like hypodermic needles they stick their mouths and there i plants and stuck out plancus's this is a pitcher that keeps me awake at night quite literally um this illustrates one of the problems that i've been working on for all of my all tree basically it shows paintin a field of alfalfa over the class of about a month starting in the twenty seventh of may to the thirtieth of june the population initially is low it increases and then declines this it was taconet fundamental questions of ecology the things that professionally colleges ask his questions are what explains how fast population seem reese and then what explains the populations spot when they stop increasing and start to the clime so the next four minutes in wonderland what i know about this for he even so the first flacon population increase if you look at a aphid you see that she's really just a a a a by producing machine am currente bodies devoted to reproduction not only is he wandered to reproduction but her offspring also have there offspring a developing within them so each female has not only her daughter but also her granddaughters in them female simeuse about five or spring a day those hoping then developed about a ten days to reproduce themselves abitation a really cool trick they've done away with males so over the summer they reproduce a sexually without sex each female just truces and identical to medicate of herself it is a population growth this really makes sense if a female can reproduce at ken substitute all of her male offspring with female offspring those females produce the male stone and you automatically double the population five a in general he colleges only keep trace of the females and populations not the males even if sexual populations like humans you always assume the grouch willing and able matron to impregnate the females so you really just need to keep track of the females a if you actually do some back of the envelope tingoccio of salt to the single female you just keep er better reproduce letter offering reproduce at the end of five months you get enough aid to cover the state of wisconsin twice ten feet after that a year and a half would have a mass of aphids equal to the mass of the known universe expanding at the rate of speed of light stuff happen that we to get to the second question that i want a redress which is what causes populations to stop increasing this is a gentle answer p a pindar the popcorn of the insect world all predator love to eva for example this predator the seven spotted lady bank antisoviet of different creditors this is my favorite creditor a persean to understand what these parasitic wasps do i have to think of the movie alien because the curate creator of the movie actually got inspiration from these perched was the war in japan a into the aphid the exam develops within the still living aphid eat it out and eventually kills it to transform into a wisp of the next generation their extremely effective and what they do killing athens so what i hoped to illustrate is the two basic ecological questions on what explains how half buckleton increase and what causes those population increase to actually stop i also hope i felicitated an important lesson in college which is if you go out into nature pick something really anything and study it really really hard you actually learn a tremendous amount about a college thank you
