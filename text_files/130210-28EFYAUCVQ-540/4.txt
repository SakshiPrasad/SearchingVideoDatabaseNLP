see one and you will see that there sheathe increase of matrix cercy one okay now if you are a member from our last lecture as soon ask a question as to why we write on the multiplies explicitly right why should i nineteenth etiennette ariamenes shanghai you i i atone but the extent years the product of this mad race times the madrina will respond to the matrix a prime that you get after the first step of gaienthon rights or watery get after the first tap of gosain all these entries one going to change right okay now you can very fi ah by multiplying these two mares that the entries in the modified dairies a prime would correspond to the operations that we do in case inanition okay alas of first death ah that be a son a surprise of merican and matrix eight okay now it looks like a you can repeat this process for the subsequent steps in the ordination all you have to do is just right down explicitly how the entries of the metric a animate rita prime aid or fiesta or going to change or with the spicy a matrix chere okay now if you go ahead for complete this process so we got a prime i see one time a right so that's the matrice one and made rich eight and a double frame right which is to make rich that you are plain after the second step of going nation is going to be equal to a matrice two times a prime right so you take the new modified me tricks and multiplied by another matrix sea too now how is that when restored to look like now see to its god to operate on a prime right now what are the entries of a prime the change in the process of doing those in the nation is this came ian timari a or just a submarine of this yet so it's gravy concentrating on this submarine so you are going to do guyton on that submarine ah in fact these guys will all be zeros right okay so that make freshet has a similar form to the matrix ah see one right except that the multiplies now would be shifted to the right so right on the form of medication alex plain wise take that's specific forth so it's going to have one's resistin the first rob because you're not going to change the first row of further new may fix a prime right and you not got to change the second row of the new matrix a five right so you still go to have a zone there for the second rope okay and then the new multipliers or going to take position along this calm like this so this will be the multiplier corresponding to eight re two prime like that okay stood the most applies for a pounding to a for two prime will be this guy and this
