ah in a straightforward way it's going to be really hard right to how many more showing in a computer now we were able to get to the product while first we've got to be in verse and then to the product of the inverse in a preformed right and this is a very useful frequently nearer okay so you will keep repeating this i mahameta again sorry this is a too for i so want ter oh it's i think it's a lot easier to deal with a small attic because when i write this mates i always keep in mind the last entry i for it down their sorry i'm really sorry the wonder so now this here is the matrix all right what it is a lower trying the metric okay and we have a asiatics you and all happens to be just the mare with the multipliers taking their respective positions right so when you do go on eatin right now inside for going through those equations what you could do as you could construct these matrices right in practice you will not construct this these mares in full because there are so many zeros that you don't want to store right but let's assume that you construct these matrices and what you would do as you would fill in the lawyer trying a load diantre by the corresponding multiplies okay and that is all dictation
