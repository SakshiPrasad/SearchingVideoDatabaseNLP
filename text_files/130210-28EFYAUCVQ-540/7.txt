do it replaces each row by a specific tone and what is that to incendiis the same equation as before news what we do as we take a row and from that surprise a multiple of roon and at is what he won us and you keep doing this for all rose from two to end key now what do you think multiplication by the windwards going to do it's going to negate this effect right so it's still has to take each rose and do what a right take each roar from two to end right and add the same multiple that we have here a times re one for us to to end right so that's what happens when you multiply by see oneness so this a picture of father marty ses very interesting because it is easy to obtain the structure of the matrix one in verse just by looking at water happens when you multiply ah by see what okay self if that is the case what would be the first row of the one in verse will nothing happen right we don't do anything with the the first row the one so i just going to be one seizes now remember when we talked about sea on the second row had a negative sign for the multiplier and that corresponded to a suppression right now you want to add the multiplied to the first room so luck would you do ye just replicate the same mad races but this time all the minuses begun a plus enchanters really beautiful so you have here an eight two one divided by a one one instant of a negative a two one divided a one on an eighty one by a one one for the third entry all the way to the last entry which will be in one by an and the rest of the entries are still the same right imagistic or this is a one one are ye this guy's a one at now that what happens when you multiply some manteline inward right so you take each rod and replace that row by a multiple of the re one and added to that room okay so when you keep doing that for all the rose from two theron so it's easy to pain the testator see one in verse so what will be seen to in verse is exactly the same as a city except that you had replaced the minor signed by plain right okay so it's right down all right it here the two inverse for example and be this may rectis goin be a plus now sit and eightyone to i by eight two two prime sides of one lisselan the last entries canoe and two prime to ye by eight to two prime for forfeits is the same marie as this except that you had the negative sign me placed by passion right great now that is beautiful because so we do not have to do any complicated operations in or to find out what the inverse once he to it a draw right we were able to write down explicitly just by looking at the operation in walmington in see one and see to to get the expressions for see one in recency to inwards
