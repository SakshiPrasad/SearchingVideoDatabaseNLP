extends we will have an inverse for bed i now but i see i taste you sorry yet so is making a lot of miss leary i now you have the product of a bunch of mares and your computing the inverse have you guys seen ah a formiliar would get you to inverter so noteworthy in wars of a product of two metres is what is the price of the inverse but the matrices in the reverse order right kettelopotomachia you will have to compute the inverse of sea one first right and then you multiplied by sea to in verse i keep doing that to see and in a one inverse right that is going to be the inverse of the product of all these men to as it is have a takers and then slipped them right and multiplied by you not what would be your guess as to the structure of this complicated looking product a lord frimaire right ah but not so quick because we have to sell establish a what is the inverse of see one what is in versificated ra and after that we have this stablished that the product is indeed a lower trilobites and the beauty here is that it is a lower trimeter and not just that you will see that the lower trying a matrix will be filled up by the multipliers that we see in sea one seat to etcetera okay and we see exactly half so eight questions before we proceed further so while we did now it's basically transformed by process of donation on the equations of mastering a into a matrix operation that in wales multiplying the matric a by a bunch of lower trying rameses see one he too and all the way up to see in man a swan i keep in mind the major ses one he to a tetra or all no trying time to cease okay now how do you understand what the one in verses for example so how do we interpret these one in verse for example that is what happens when you multiply some matribus one envers okay it's a very clear as to what would happen when you multiply a matrix some metres by e when it very right but it is easy to understand this if we look at the matron he touton minus one as operators right self what does the multiplication by he when you sent if we can answer this question right then what applying by sea in verse has to do the exact opposite of what we do here right has to knowles what we do when we multiply by sea on so let's first understand what happens when we most apply by the one okay so this is what the i meant then i said see one he threw a cetera can be considers operators okay you see what operation is performed by multiplying by the one and negate that or nullify that in order to produce the operation for spalding to see one in verse okay so if you will happen when you multiply by sea one no musoline by sea one takes each rose right in forearm the second to the last drop right and what is
