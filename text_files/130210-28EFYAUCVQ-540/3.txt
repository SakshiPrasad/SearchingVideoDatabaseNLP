to james the doric of two rectors remember a prime to j which is the product of a rich is the the seculars entry in the product of those two matrices is going to be the detroit of the second rule of sea one right and the j column of emetic eight now due have the jasko of matrix e in the expression yes can i write down this here so what would be the first entry for this rector here this guy i exactly so that's right down what would be the second and three that's when i multiply that eight to ja that happens to be a want right i ont be one what about the rest of the empress there was eroshka now if you put this into the second row of a the matrix he one would you agree that what we are basically doing us is the first step of agustin for the second roof but every one agreed to that gate the full it up so we have a b this guy for our member this is going to operate on each cambrig okay so when you do that only the first two entries mare the restaurans dears right so for example if you take the dark product of the second room here and let's say the third came right only the first two entries are going to be multiplied by nonius and that is exactly what we do ingurgitation right or you replace the second drove by a multiple of the first row and that multiple happens to be the entry in this position okay now what would the third girl so we still in step one gineration what do you do it a third row you have a multiflora third right so where do you think that multiple will go and sit you say here an the onetor the third row so that means what would you oscillate let's say ary one aware place a three one by this guyot's there a zibet so that is fine that taken care of here warbottom forenoon be this guy right so you take a the third entry in the matrix and from that you surprised a specific multiple of the entry in the first room right so and you keep doing that for the rest of the entries in the peroo matrix eight okay so this operation if you look at the entry carefully right can be written in a similar way as we did the for the second rope and you will see that the multiplier was sit exactly here okay except that you will have a zero and the one okay now multiplying this role by each share column would give you the entries of the third ruin the product may fix right and that will crepon to the guianian operation that you would do on the third rule of matrix eight now you can keep doing this you can do this step that i showed here right and fill up the entries of varatic see
