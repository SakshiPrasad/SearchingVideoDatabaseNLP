h m what people think about a college they often think about national geographic they think about exotic places like propane forests they think about a charismatic animals like lions and tigers but really you can learn just as much if not more about ecology by looking at very mundane things like this in the agricultural fields of wisconsin a sisa family portrait of papists a mother and her offspring am there feeding at the tip of an a house now you might gather from the name perpetui on peas but they also feed on beans clover and of course i'll sell for him they have mouth parts but a like hypodermic needles they stick their mouths and there i plants and stuck out plancus's this is a pitcher that keeps me awake at night quite literally um this illustrates one of the problems that i've been working on for all of my all tree basically it shows paintin a field of alfalfa over the class of about a month starting in the twenty seventh of may to the thirtieth of june the population initially is low it increases and then declines this it was taconet fundamental questions of ecology the things that professionally colleges ask his questions are what explains how fast population seem reese and then what explains the populations spot when they stop increasing and start to the clime so the next four minutes in wonderland what i know about this for he even so the first flacon population increase if you look at a aphid you see that she's really just a a a a by producing machine am currente bodies devoted to reproduction not only is he wandered to reproduction but her offspring also have there offspring a developing within them so each female has not only her daughter but also her granddaughters in them female simeuse about five or spring a day those hoping then developed about a ten days to reproduce themselves abitation a really cool trick they've done away with males so over the summer they reproduce a sexually without sex each female just truces and identical to medicate of herself it is a population growth this really makes sense if a female can reproduce at ken substitute all of her male offspring with female offspring those females produce the male stone and you automatically double the population five a in general he colleges only keep trace of the females and populations not the males even if sexual populations like humans you always assume the grouch willing and able matron to impregnate the females so you really just need to keep track of the females a if you actually do some back of the envelope tingoccio of salt to the single female you just keep er better reproduce letter offering reproduce at the end of five months you get enough aid to cover the state of wisconsin twice ten feet after that a year and a half would have a mass of aphids equal to the mass of the known universe expanding at the rate of speed of light stuff happen that we to get to the second question that i want a redress which is what causes populations to stop increasing this is a gentle answer p a pindar the popcorn of the insect world all predator love to eva for example this predator the seven spotted lady bank antisoviet of different creditors this is my favorite creditor a persean to understand what these parasitic wasps do i have to think of the movie alien because the curate creator of the movie actually got inspiration from these perched was the war in japan a into the aphid the exam develops within the still living aphid eat it out and eventually kills it to transform into a wisp of the next generation their extremely effective and what they do killing athens so what i hoped to illustrate is the two basic ecological questions on what explains how half buckleton increase and what causes those population increase to actually stop i also hope i felicitated an important lesson in college which is if you go out into nature pick something really anything and study it really really hard you actually learn a tremendous amount about a college thank you
