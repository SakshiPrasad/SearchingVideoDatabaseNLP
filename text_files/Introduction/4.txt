i sent indians lips in the rather idea it is edited by a h this editors are movement donate even designed smaller tinkeles with their estates responsive or natural banks that are inherent in sudden actions so for example one more time can was all the study and the two ewes defined as the time taken by a sharp needle to piers a lot of leaf nor aspeden is god in ward asked still pickand they went again just like previous ten they built up oh so hundred thoughts the make up one laban thirty lowers and we found the one nemesis a fish smaller times hers a refined and natively laetis hills are also provide it for example that you go and omaha except and these times here a useful because they realized that there are differently when i tarascon which have defend in heretical time scales so a cosmologically went has sidepost has to be described by a time skilled at his nateral to the cosmological even so a cosmologically went may be deviate descried by mummius are you got well as a small time scale that you are experiencing in daylie might be described by moore which is basically based on hidetada it which is also i again as you realize is it nasturtian that i sat by outmarched the ven tis found out that there were other times giles i am at ellora the blinking of an eye it takes some time for you to bring thee and that the use to define are you not called the mesa and similar other and as i said a before am one important thing to keep in mind is that different authors are so sometimes use different times hills and i use the same name for example so one has to be careful i so put on economical time kills for example would defer despite the use of the same name but the important take oere is not accuracy of the time scales aweather their lighter wrong but rather the important pickaway here so what is the takeaway why are discussing this so the take owes that different physical phenomena how different tamesis that should be used to describe them and the idea that systems have inherent response time in the cervantes and this idea will also be key to our understanding or soft matter this idea that differential eromena had deferent responsive arabian inherent tamesis that are associated with them this comes up in a number noumenal obesity i will use quite a bit in the course so this brings us
