classical flew it and then the vitalistic list was the same way in between now the classical last elemosina classic and viscus or a fluid desert ideas from antinomianism antinomian candicans will see that both these two tongs are understood very well there are nested with the mathematical precision so we will use this word in the beginning quite a bit and this colassie a one mortellerie mentioned here is that this is also a dynamical concepta i mean by when i say in eminance it means that we are going to look at a classical elasticity of musical fluid wear or even the disclaimer from the prospective of the application of a force on a material and then understanding that a man so that material to that force or so what we are done to laws we went over some good books and he said my apologist of the books which have left out there many of them i could not i would all of them yet we looked at some of the definitions and now what we want to do is look at a historical constet context and will look at the ancient time keeping systems but before we look at the historical context so well to just talk about before we talk about historical point i'd like to stop for a moment and i like to give you a reason why we are doing this so remember if you may so most of your work and in this course should be familiar with what a classical elastic as ones and you probably remember from your undergraduate classes that for a elastic body we would light simiot e into a silent when absolutism sure of stress a siamese of strain some measure of strain in the system this is a measure of stress and this ease some mateless elastic modulus the equation is better retinas sigma pi o into eaters it elinor and i have deliberately ride now into this because i want to emphasize that the strains and the stresses can functions of time but what is a question saying is that the instantaneous dress depends on the instant in italy of strain and by severe it almost implies that the system responses in finite a few put some amount of strain this amount a stress is going to be instant in his legioned but we know that systems take time to react this whenever you apply a force are you at into study a system assistance have her own responses so there are usually natural time calls that are associated with a system as pants sedition to understand what this tankard and how there relevant in this particular context which is why i want to unless i want a high light a couple of things from the historical context here and i just want to look at the issue of time in the indicative because the idea of time was vitiated in some of the indians and i i'd like to use a very decisively as he said portierie so wayward start with that and this court is
