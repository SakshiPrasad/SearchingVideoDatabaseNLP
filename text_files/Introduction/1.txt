to this course mobility got to know some of the element wards for example you might have heard of the word calais he whatever already well at the harbor where it is colette so that at many different keywords that are operative in this domain and i don't want to go were all of them but porteous important tom we should be familiarising ourselves with at the very onset and if latron the as morton's verisimilar as it smiles our seadet as and when required so the first tom obviously says the courses called soft matter the first important tom we want to understand so is the town soft cadence made of soft matter now a corinto a ajalon and the books of canister he defines soft matter or soft and estates as a convenient tool or medicine states of matter that needed implicit nor isoline solids as we can see this definition appeals somewhat to your intuition and it is asking you that before you even familiarizes the soft caress mater you should know what implicit are and what crystalline all its are and so matter is a state of made that is a more in between these two so is appealing to your induction in the sense that what is an in between strait you should be able to understand unsightly into the level no implicit whenever we say liquid probably the most commonly quit that a human can order were people who think of but we water when we say issuance ah you might prowling of steel some matter it as very good examples of these states of matter so soft wataire something that is integrities to and this intrude ideas actually very helpful because it does let you figure out what the mater for the is in another that book lore which is called soft metaphysics by an author brow massabie stays that soft made includes a large class of meteors and then he goes on to any mere some of the possible meteors which he says while i as called a fact and sliced cristos cetera with a common feature of consisting of flowers totality two characteristics large and on interessantes low and nonillions so the first part of this definition is still a peregrination in the sense that it is sin to any merit some of the possible soft mates that are there and then at her you two important characteristics of them and these caritatis are actually they come from a statical mechanics or microscopic few point we take these up later on in the course also we are desired the term collidges maybe we should define it at this very onset will probably be using this stone quite a bit socalled is a collier dispersion so call at the word caldicot form for clodion so coordination is a dispersion of one false into another where the dispersed particles and the microscopic regime and then the virgin's given to you is from ziogoon which is ten animate to hundred micon's and this definition it also stadion one dimension of the particle needs to be in this range and this is taken from foundations of cologne right hander arranter this tom colquitt silos in counter in ours in due course but a term that is good very important for us and we are going to use that quite a bit at the very onset is viscosity and viscous deity here is defined as the property of my dianic involves aspects of two types of a man natural response classical rusticity and classic and fluid this definition which is taken from the book mechanical response of palamas we wymington initially does seem like it is also a piling to your intuition in that it is asking you to think of a classical lastest
