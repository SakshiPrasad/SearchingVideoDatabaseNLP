in the long welcome to the second lecture on interaction to soft matter we were discussing in the last glass the various time scars are the nitrating skies that were discribed in some of the indicted we are just discussed at the for example in times that delusion taken for a twinkling at a twinkling of an eye in the case then there was a another time slone to ty and to day is the time taken by a shot neither and piercing a lotus petal many other times he had also discussed obviously a like days linaments years exeter and this as some the ancient time kills that would be cussed in many different texts one of the foremost ex being the surest tanta which was a texas on amy you can find a many of the reference materials in book coincident in the lips in intimate tics which is edited by adam the lied books has many different chapters contributed by other authors but the very point that we are discussing natural time hers was to ensure that we are neander that the fen the phenomena which are associated with their own natural time scale along with this comes the idea that natural systems have a response time and in order to understand a observe that system we have to naturally be able to first and foremost appreciate what the times hillside with the system is a very important experiment in this context is called a very clear very famous experience all the pitch tropic ferment and in this manuscript which is called a pitch to experiment was re published in the european journal of physics we have authors awards darter and parnell and he described this i will go to the pedant it more men but i just wanted the scope to you what the pistol experiment was so in the fire that department of physics at the inutile in brisbane is an experimental lestrade for teaching purposes the fluidity of the hardy hideosity of pitch set up in ninety guenever by rose thomas parnell the first process is exter now when we talk of something of pitch which is usually by product the natural product we think of it in terms of a solid but this very famous experiment challenge too few point and is often looked up on his ear one of the pioneering experiments in trying to undastand viscous deity so here as in the beginning on ready readier to you that we have at the department of physics very high hiester pitch which was proceeded to illustrate and what he did is we set up a very simple experiment you have a funnel shaped are here just me sure so this is the paratus and then you have pitch that is contained within it and what happens is much like water or much like a fluid you have the pitch starting form droplets and then this fall down into this beaker now obviously pitch has a very very high viscosity and because it is a very high viscosity this is not going to be fast in human terms so this experiment was set up and esaron of a very long running experiment and this experiment they found that the drop as a single drop usually comes out at around eight to nine years of time so they went around and you are welcome to more redisposed leisure which is again at the pitch drop experiment by eduard duanan panel it was published the european on physics in idea before and the other into important thing i wanted to city point out is the record of the pitch drops are there to nineteen thirty when the first it was started
