in the very beginning we had said that oft made often as my dicaeopolis in states of matter are neither simple liquids nor distillin solids right so what happens to the laxities here in case of simple ecrits now we know it if you do i recall superanda adet horses wi you to say that a liquid is one thing that cannot stand here at all which means that it has to respond instantaneously so with less worn instantaneously then this fatime scale yolanda becomes zein that case ye so we come infinitely small which master the midianites ponding almost immediately to afford a leistering to flow so you is if i did useful to a less and that if there were a number ten to zee we say that macadamised a light very much like a fluid on the other hand this by the application of force from a common in the standing we see that the solid never flows right so the time killers with slow of her solid body is in almost infinitely large compared to that of a liquid so the other extreme detricand consider here is that listened so if they were a number then standpoint we say that materials like a sunlit light aside so that one did of considering these to extreme cases this we are now really do in a sense begin discussing one of his scholastic or material a soft mater would be and you can probably guess that when we say this caustic mates are soft medias the devil on numberest with them with be a finite quantity sienite be somewhere beginnin finity and that where it lies between her and infinite gives you an idea of whether it is by more like a liquid or more like a solid so some of the places of medersas we are discussed and we'll see later areas of a siliceous will have a finite the burnum and that the vernal becomes important similarly for other types of soft mateless now we see that although the original definition here appealed to induce in some senses so all other this ah here it is does not really stated water implicit or christlichen with the use of the vernal began one start conty fine our understanding of softies in a sense no what i'd like to do is i like to consider a couple of problems so i go ahead and have a sample one so let's say you have a sphere of radios art and some fluid is coming with a velocity of you are you infinite the three steamboat of you infinite then in this system and it is given to you that this fluid has a relaxation time of lamda so this is given so alesage
