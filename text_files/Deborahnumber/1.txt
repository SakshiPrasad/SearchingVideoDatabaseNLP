to nineteen thirty eight the first drop fall nineteen forty seven is an a second opal is almost a gap of a nine years there then the third dragoon i ten fifty fourth almost a gap of seven ines here then fifty four to sixty two a so that about eighty years and not counting a month but approximately that the time scale same agin you are creature which could only view something at intervale six years or seventy years for you with every if you're thinking of you you were alien creature so let us imagine for a second that this an alien creature where history king of the eye is there to bring a die is takes six to seven years of human time for them the moment he blinks his eyes the next moment a drop a swamp has fallen in a sense for him the material would not seem like a solid it would seem more likely quick with this you have dropped its coming out so but for humans our thinking her at the blinking of an eye is much faster so for us it all a seems a lather long time to wait for a drop before and it is appropriate in the meantime if you are using pithom like that in your life laboratory for experiment that is only lasting ten minutes is appropriate to discuss that as a solid body what this experiment or what the framework ah what retained to understand is the idea that just a second all open at the other doctor went at i want to discuss so i hope you sort of understand that when you are discussing the mid metelin properties of the madisons the two things that are important and that is why i discussed the two issues one was the time scale associated with the phenomena and then the other is the time of europe as and these two became very very important in understanding the film in itself all this idea was a proposed that this i decide anne to a non demesne a important number at this as proposed by rene in a paper that was polishing nineteen sixty four aniline physics to day and in the beginning he is so the is it's a after the atoghia pluto this manuscript and in adoration his sad describing a situation which sort of lead to the entasis to the discussion but important thing that here he wants to say is that he was inspired by the story of profit poetaster bore and in a famous song after the vicar the philistine seating the mountains flowed before the lord when over the andes ago the bible translated it into english the translators who had never heard of heraclitus translated a passage the mountains melted with for the lords bitter but they were new of tootings first that the mountains flow and that as everything flows but secondly that the flood before the lord and ogier the man for the simple is that man in his short lifetime cannot see them flowing where is the time of of the vision of god is infinite so using so remainder stand these lines are from the old estimate of a bible that is is a story from that but he is using this as an inspiration to go head and define a very very important a mefres which is going to become the devon ober and this developed he defines as the time of relaxation divided by the time of observation so ah your motion pellisier also at elise but for us the important thing is the definition of the developer which is defined right now as time of relaxation divided by the time of observation what is this time of relaxation so i'll come to that
