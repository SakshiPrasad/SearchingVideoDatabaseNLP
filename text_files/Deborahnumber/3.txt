but more importantly we had another tomb this quickly going back to this that is the observation right so this time is also there this term is slightly easier to understand and de observation can either be a time scale associated with experimental sessions with experimental measurements or it can also be that i'm skill associated with the floor if you take it as a time skill as a side with a floor often people tend to write the develour in that case the cat to die it is t by the of floote question is what is the time kallolo the best we do understand that is to some examples but we like not on in her that is a reciprocal of the average sheet can also be taken as a time skill of the floor it's so we not here that reciprocal of the sedate gillier's gone a dot can be taken as a florimell and this is usually done for statistics lasso you are make another note which you say usually done for steady statut if you do that then the question for there were a number this becomes lander into canada that is usually another number the two use often in a desolate city or soft matter which is for the visible number the double eye which is usually defined as always as lambert commodo so this is called dubois stands for why i send word number so if you're a stark using the sheet of that reprisal on the sheet as it appropriate in scale then the number of the devil on one of that in that case becomes identical with the white man name to this an important point now so i list quickly summarized his port before we summarise this another couple of things i'd like to mention so now i see in the very very beginning this go back to this definition
