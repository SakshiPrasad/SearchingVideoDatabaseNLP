no it does real dealings or financial markets and and so on so for so ah you men i you don't care about cetaceans a unit market will it ility which is one of the biggest criticism of cooper ency he will see a lot of application of block game nothing to do it prepotency and this course will i try to teach you why that is the case and in fact i mercurially is a strong critic of couture like bit quin and another and therefore my interest the is that peple learn that even if you don't care about cookery you should care about lucenay because it's a transformative technology so discourses about that solesgate some examples where we can use lochans discuss some problems that you can probably saw with logan and i'm not going to initially talk about how we can solve it at locks and because we haven't to you how the blocks in works but i'll tell you what the problem sir with our traditional way of this libation and and he probably hit it a you know may be locked in might provide a solution so this example is by you know from abinadab a so so they will discuss how we do banking to day right so in a bank banking system ah we have multiple players right so we have tossed on must ourselves we have the banks and we have the bank employees and we have a regulator agency in case of india it is me all we i so what happens is that when you do transactions right so there are murple ways you do transactions so let's consider two of them one is your right a check to give money to somebody or you wellington a transaction like your logging to your banking a server and then you arise a fondaco and it goes to what the bankers and it does automatically not necessarily the intervention of human employees is a rejects if your balance is greater than your transaction amount if it is not then i will say it is an invalid and action it will reject the transaction if it is yes then it will transfer the conduction amount from your account to the other persons are pascoe and you're a conquered by the rite by that aronsen amount now how do you know that this is done it caporal you check your transaction left on line or you get your monthly statement and then you check that all the transactions you mane recorded correctly now the question is who is maintaining this later from which this mantle statement is generated the bank thus no they because of regulatory rambure that we have we don't see banks doing something wrong in this case which we never are almost never find that you know i made it onsartin and it was i it went through but now in my statement i don't see it or i don't see a normal i don't see that i never did it injection and it is appearing in my in my statement this kind of things did not and don't normally happened but it could happen how could it happen we o the legeres wrong or if somebody inside the bank tampered with the leger and put it on action in there which was not made by you in those cases we say that it selinville transaction and her you say that i did not attentat and orisons action or your balance was not efficient and the transaction still went through an don't have over drafted in such cases we say that the transaction is invalid and you good the bank and in moscas the bankbill be very surprised and they will not know the happiness i gate and altenstein happen in case of jack's also somebody can fold your check is presently happened to one of the top medical educational institute recently about well cours of money were transported jacks and those checks were checked under you will light by the banking arteries then they turned out to be an out and take checks with the institute said that it didn't do the renderin or what if for an extra race foot at the end of the amount fried and some hot tempered with so matstead that you have done it but you can't you say that no and another possibilities somebody of your legator password and some how full you into reviling her or keep or did he seem road to
