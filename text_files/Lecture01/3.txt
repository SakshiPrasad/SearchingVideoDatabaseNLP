get your prince you getting them and in this case i also he would know what happening so it's a very difficult for the are you men with the bank so if i go and say that if you repudiate that i have one made this transaction the bank may not believe it because it will take that you are to you no proof that you don't do it so i call on repudiation you don't have the non repudiate if you argue there among was modified than their mount that you actually conducted then you reshingling the integrity of the data that is being now presented to you and there also you if you don't have a proof of what do islemen then it real is your word against this and finally do you even tally the transactions like if you add or the entire debatin credit when you get your monthly statement most ceprano and and therefore we depend or we trust the banks are on all the issues so the way the bank maintains its data about your transactions is not very conspiring to us we trust them to do it and we trust them because they had their answer but the regulatory of the ritual we i and therefore i trust them but that's what he areca by a trusty heart party in force trusted and that is often a problem in in case of a robe banks and and things like that and so we are at bucketing here is more transparency in the way the conduction are done and traductions in records her maintain and as we see that the block cane could be one of the solutions which will provide transparency and also maintain the integrity of the data and therefore were provide more reason for us to trust the the banking system without a trusted therefore in forcing the trustworthiness no second problem i want to talk about here it is a plight and prominence to what after seeable and is that you order something you are business and you order something from another supplier and that's a player also orders various farce from a curculio in the tertulia orders various parts from a fort uppers so this is what is called a supply can and when the final product is made you as business is making products whose quality depends on the quality of percipience and other things that you have got through this splicing and therefore if your quality as a problem may be it is not your manufacturing problem or your construction problem but it is somewhere down the line in the supple and you have to attribute whose follies and to do that you have to have proper transparency about where all the components a coming from normally we only know the person was supplied us with deeplier also depending on a third supplier to operate penn for supply and we don't know any of that the most of the time unless we go and investigate and also there are a quality guarantees that are not in force from your end at the every step between two consecutive supplies so i'll give your very simple example this is an example i heard from marishes suppose you are restraint and you are fine high scream from tapley sublime is not manufacturing or producing this crime but it is actually supplying from company cessatoris so to your asteer your responsible for picketty trim but i cremiere time you are getting seems to be melted so who is responsible so you can say to supply me that you probably keep thy came two long in your trap or your temperature has a problem in your track or you can say apace you made militiamen it was picked up by supply it was already melted and supply me says that when it received the temperature was too high and therefore this is the problem so how do you find the truth so one possibility is that as a restaurant you can put them preciseness on the truck of supply as well as in the factory of supplies stores it therese produced i cram and then he'll get the sense data from the supplies directly to her less network and then you keep a long an you check the log you would know where with a bersabe temperature and that's why it happened but there is certain problems and will talk about that we come by revisit this problem about the the integrity of the data that is coming from the
