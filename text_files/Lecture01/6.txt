sometimes it was fight alan sometimes it came down to eight thousand so so if you think that investing in which kind is a good idea that is not something that i would advocate if you want to invest and quickly make money in in a couple of days and i have lots of money may be you can invest in with coin but otherwise it esalan time ah a set i don't think the betkin is if it can isolate two risky unless you have that kind of risk appetite you probably don't want that do the thing is that the way with quen works so we talked about the consciences mechanism race so we have an will discuss this letter in the class how the consensus works are many ways to a river constances supineness is when all the parties agree that this transaction indeed took place and then only goes to the leger redforth's consensus process in which pine because of its unanimity and the fact that it is anybody can join the bit quieter ah so therefore we cannot tell other people are honest so therefore be constants makani has to be very very pretorian challenging and to solve those cetara hic poles and will talk talk about that letter in the course ah it recourse he means amount of computer sona power and when you do a that can of computation for arriving concerted on senses any actually have to rivet malecontents as over her a short period of time and therefore the amount of energy that you require to do that kind of competition is enormous and that with very harmful for them ferment and will see that her i fell to at the statistics that we quite mining to day actually process of riving at a constant actually also bitten mining the reason why this calming is because any time a constant is arrived there would be only one winner whose selected the tail we actually met parmenio the date store or in the block came and digited said the beginning with kind was giving fifty bet cineas we were different election becomes tarmanant then they have they to twenty five with kansas moment it is true point five with coins that you can get but this is how it cataracted therefore this consensus process in with coin it is calls also called with kind mining and this mining process is so so expensive in terms of competition in therefore in terms of artesian that it is consuming more electricity than a one fifty nine countries including our land and most contriving a recusant thing how wistfully it is to actually a mind with pins sir an any other treachery that is also based on participation of public anonymously would have to have a similar kind of consensus process and therefore they will also be wasting a lot of power and that is a big concern for from the environment point of view also it becomes very expensive to buy equipment which are capable of doing such computation and therefore it gets more tinted toward people who have depots at you and i with our regular leftover or other machines we cannot in all have the ability to win this process of consensus we cannot make with points were the teraph have invested millions of dollars in buying goodman and an unpaying liquidity will an air conditioning bill for their he which competed forms and therefore they are abode the so this makes this entire bit gwine ecosystem very very tilted towards those people and be other things that most of this with quin mining companies now actelly there companies which actually can only afford such large skill with quinine and this many of the companies are in china now what happens is that it is it is probable that if one person or one pair in the bit in platform has more than fifty one per cent of the computational power then he can actually completely change the data in the big kind network so already there in a block came the data that we foster after a consensus is then put proof right nobody can come and change the data the reason why they cannot do that because to their amount of competition they have to do in order to temper it is too much because they have
