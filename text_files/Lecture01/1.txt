banking sabers and what you did what transactions you may all this a log the main problem with keeping logs without any notion of trajection of the integrity is that somebody can tamper with the logs and somebody can delete some of the accesses and therefore lateran when you check the logs you would know some part of its history so therefore the blocking is a designed in a such a way so that it's an immutable leger of events which means it a log that cannot be changed by a malicious take and therefore all the data that you put in there a could we event long it could be transactions it could be various kinds of access and a modification to dose or to some other thing or like a data or you go a property transaction all these things logs are has to be kept in any mutable made leger and that's what rocked him provides so it's in naniamo ng of this data is made war tulips so we don't take it impossible to temper as will see as we learn more that there if you have a very high computational power a which is almost impossible for individuals together but if you can gather that kind of competition power you can actually subvert and this all the protection and change but since it is what sally impossible we can we with say an this is a temporising long and therefore with having the properties we basically use not an as a platform to create and transact cookery so cold to carency as will say with coin iterum tis a critical ensis and will see that one of the first application of lochan was within so the well idea of creating currency that was transactions who creation whose use everything has to be put in at a temper reproved log and without a trustier peter without a central agency which gives struck off this log and it'll be curer as we go into the course and also are you know many people confuse or conflict the idea of it can and lottie and as will see through the course that of croppers just as part of the story and there any number of other applications in which we need to keep temple roof or temporising logs and they are blocking is a very good ah you know a platform to use so why do you need a course on locking right so sir exile in i feel look at the news and if you read them mostly a no that acknowledging you you see a lot of news on unwatering in bitpin its prices going up and down were is kind of other issues that come up as sometimes there are siberian retrogress or sometimes repose to tokens for various reasons or to to crises are being used for illegal activities it arian is another such her certainty now you will also hear a lot of news like for example a ull hear that you like the emirate sir is fully going on with locator their most of the governance applications governance i means that you know all kinds of things like property that i station and ere you know carelians ng or la in a license and river license in all times of things they are doing on blockhead many other countries are doing the same thing some thing you will hear a lot about supplying management on lochan or you hear a energy management especially in case of my regrets and renewable energy you will hear a lot about that plication of lochan or or you know electric weakling station and and a paying for the care you know a electric charging and all that on a block gemlike in germany so very tony will hear that of locking his forth everything for nerone often say that okay so this is a new height and how a lot of hyperbole so what will see in this course is that it is not high and it is anology white gronsport technologies so many people compare it with the advent of the internet in transforming our lives and digitalin and similarly a people say that or predict that lock chenes going to be as trustworthy the in the way we did it live or functioning and our governance and our
