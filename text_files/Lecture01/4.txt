we end up place you went when you actually would do centres and will see how may be the blockin might be a solution a turn problem here is land records so many of your worth this movie a colic a costly rites so so you buy a piece of land and somebody claimed that he owns the land and show you some paper work and you paid him or heard the money and landago echec and lenity of his ears the land belongs to the owner so you trusted that any went ahead and paid and then this person disappears then it hurt were an comes and says that this land actually is a mine and i sasellano stating it so at this point you go back to the registry and reduce it always made a mistake actually as some data was missing and now we know that this version is right now you're to have basically have no land even though you paid somebody who is now missing so as somebody might have changed the land record twice once he in the name of that other guy and then a name of this guy and all their logs for this change of this data i have also gone missing because we are trusting the language or to ride to maintain being dignity of the land record and also if any access is made for changing any of the land records may be the logs as to be protected also but the logs were not protect properly because it's an insider who has there managed to delate relevant entreating the logs or it troth excess the log also there has been a question about your unharnesses so remembered that there was a case where a people who did their using other attention the de their caviar getting sincere from her tell the artels bank also made an air same heavily to clear the account in your name and then all the honor were cooking a subsidy was being now deposited to that bank account but this is actually shed is washed down letter on this process but we need to know who is accessit or a date to the earther database for doing etais then you will hear you idea i decided that through their website you can go there and see who access your other lother information i would equation your listing but it didn't throw that demographic look up properly but it should be hekalu but this loves are now maintained by adiante to if you trust your idea then he will say okay be that though leptines when somebody did i kawamabad if you if you think that somebody is dingily and somebody inside the you idea might have deleted the lots there is no way to prove at disprove that so there is a trust problem that can build up so therefore i know in this case also the temper roof property of the logs should be somehow and wincing to the customers or to the users so that they can trust that what he weltering as long of their equity is indeed the only times when there hekaston so that tenawa spoken about four problems one is your banking fanarin lads and there tempering possibility secondly talked about supplying data and suppliance and there temper proof property thirteen with talabor land registry and meat for an tinterton that data and maintaining keeping the integrity of the logs of excessive and modifying the data for tingeing above the ecaillere idea and in all these cases in the current tradition of system we have to trust it hurtado we have to trust me the uterine whose maintaining the data to actually maintain the integrity of the state and that may or may not be very prudent to trust for nantilly the great submission and manent system in a unit in a university or in the institute we professors sobered on line and it was to a ladevese and that database is now you know maintained and then the students in the logging to see their great serina print out there retired they actually access the italics not between the time professor so with the day
