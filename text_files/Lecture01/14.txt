there now what should be able to do them for with it i so logan is actually a frame work that can be actually very good use in this place in case that we just described so will see letter that very stand up lock tents and ushant dis kind of problems not necessarily we take this problem because the problem is probably a too simple a problem to discuss later but you get the idea that here important parts that even with all the tipografico measures like detegat ures and uninterupted message of indication cord you still have a calabria problem and conference problem that needs to be solved and the one simple solution would be to have a trusted their forty to collect all the data and kept but trust it herpetic not something we want because he again gives her brines back to the alteration mechanism were you have to somehow put your trust in ettersberg instead if you can eat a competition platform in which trust is by word you of the computational process then it's much better solution and more farlin to so that what we would like to do so we are at the end of our first lecture so in the first lecture what we learn is that no janies about distributed record keeping a trust moder varies but having a single point of trust is never good and based on the cross model you may have to use local but depending on who you trust and how much you trust you have must proliferent types of luccheni see parisian lockshen non par mission or public gottan and also private doctor so this are the same of the different agencies and bason how much you trust which party and an how much you know about the players who will be actually participating in the constant process in the valuation of the data process then you would have to choose that different types of clocolan we try to learn how does things are done or what at the different considerations that go into choosing this kind of alternatives they integrity we talked a lot about no one tempered with the data after his creation is very important and that were blocking into play and ottentot transactions and even logging is something very important if you want to know not nessita detail but made a date that is the data about who access the data and who modified the data who added the date that kind of information and strong good agraphia applications rockiness rong use of cryptography and got canes not certainly only about rituals and in this course will not be focussing on to to currency but we talk about some of the technology of wit quin and eternal that because i need to understand the underlying technology so summer of lecture one so what did you learn the need to learn about docking an application is what we impressed on to day because of the various applications we talked about it coenopolis or only examples of this technology but this technology have much broader usage and much more potential tusmore depends determines what kind of block genial gin to use recalled lock will block in saleroom because that's something also one has to take away from this course because man times it now i get request that can you help us to do block can for our application and when you actually investigate closely they are trusted onions and there there there operating environment and you find that under the trust of amiens and everything black jim is not in required or if we be an over hill right so you have to also get a beehive to have the critical understanding of when blocked him can be of help and hath a have value and also what kind of lockin is good for that particular application basic issues that led to the creation of a bit plain about the not trusting the banks and an the oetatis third party or a interlarded werstlein providence an integrating tremorel conferences that arise when there many players and may be in that case intemerata collector like a cloud may be or may be not a good solution and a faltered consensus is required in working of the block in consciences making ism and were coldly trust morely shows so this is the
