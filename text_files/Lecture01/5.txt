and when the student seized the data we do in that time if somebody inside her actually changes a great then there is no way for the professor to know because prefer my dear four hundred students in the class and unless there is an investigation when he might have written records of the thing of the data but if nobody has complained and the very offer distantly now unless the great change has been very drastic like somebody supposed to get near and gotten as but an otherwise they will be there be no way to know that the data integrity has been violated and the person who did this inside might also remove the log of access in that they do bessand that could be a problem and therefore there is not enough transparency in which the detailment and without in a leaking out the private information like the great of students but that should be transference of how the the tasman tent and and some kind of proof that does him digit of the data has not been tampered with and then only this there be full trust from the students or from the professors that this system is tempered proof and there is no way to for somebody to come and change the water from from inside or by truth some sybaritic or something like that so these are the things where a block in might come handy as i acknowledge to solve this question that i have raised so far so people might expect that oh so this is a course on block came so sir it might be about with coin and teramore learn how to actually transact and all that stuff but that's not the case and here is why i would and are you then why i don't want a course on with kind or terence however if you're interested in the full dynamics of bit coinin and how it were an how you actually make her transactions and how you can make him know my copies and all that would be quite then you can actually go to corcyra and there is a very nice course by professor a no i win a nathian who actually are from princeton and whose course is about with kindly right but her course his not on with quin and the reason is that wit quin is something that has also created a lot of concern about repugnancy so one of the very early story after the bit cindamine existence was the history of the sipra sirdars in under known market and underground in the sense that it was being carried out in the dark wet so dark web is basically is the part of the web were a people don't have direct access likely got and wayside of a new organization or an institute or or abuses this are but places which are accessible through the web but they're not excisable directly by common people you have to noisettes of the ante location and probably very strong of indication and many times you cannot even go to them without using some anonyma and only mutabor like a tor toreros and there they be under a people from the underground operation of drug and other things extortions and all the stuff they aculeata in with coin and tito was dismantled by it beyond it to tallantire or so but there is still a lot of business i know that where that happens using be in because with canes almost anonymous there is no way if you ask me to send money to a particular bit canarese other is no way to know whose address it is even far from the law enforcement agencies and therefore it's very difficult to trace and this is the same thing that is happening to day when there is a ransom were attack and andover at a curse it and tripped her inter dis by earning a man were at two your efficient linger some day and then they actually demand money to unintroduced device by an they won't have you to pay a bit coin or its area because of the anonymity that they can hide be head so that one of the problem of it mine as illegal activities and all ear and some were disease of the problems but there are other problems right to one of the thing you would know that with gentrice go up and down sometimes they want to close to twenty thousand dollars a bit can and now i think it is about well
