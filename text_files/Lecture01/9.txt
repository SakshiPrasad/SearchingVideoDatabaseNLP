what do actually he understood be how to create any consisted in which there is replication distribute rety consensus making him all this technology and albert of that already existed in the distributed system lacerated he actually brought them together and also brought together there are some some already existing concepts of the ital cash and the idea of what he called no double spinning and all that think together he brought them together and treated with me so we are kind of like happy to have the technology with us but with quite a search or or if you consider it a reminder reprobates we have seen in the last ten years or so there is too much interest by investors to part there as its there and if that happens then the old idea of a currency what is a currency carency something to which you exchange value right now if you'll just part it somewhere then it's not it's not being used as a currency ben being for use these as storage media of value answered that his one problem so it's not been used so much as media of the exchange the private gay telling and private case at extends is putting people to enormous risk of losing large amount some money there are vulnerable in the cording of the smart contracts and other parts of the cord which was his risk of losing money they also market will it ility bason various news as i was mentioning and therefore there is a lot of possibilities of losing money there is a lot er energy estate we talked about that the climate impact and that too much concentration in one country which is also a problem and then there is regulates because relates of different countries are framing their rules for allowing our defiling tokay or regulating them and also criminal activities used with coins all this together may basically make us not to focus on with coin or pipe to cerini the course even even then will talk quite a bit about the bit quin and it rembas of learning from them the technological underpinning which is very useful and very word be to understand will talk about it in how it works at the consensus works there and and also will talk about iteriad smart contracts and all that but will not focus on the supplication of boccaneras application of locino non co to carency wage in the course so then coming back to baccano let's say gotten technology is a detail in ovation that as a potential to significantly impact trusted computing activities and therefore sibert concerns as a hold subtracted computing is of ease is a concert that when you do computing and effulgent on the results of the computing and vicompte well not only minuter trenching also mean the interrogatory by exchange of information over the net work the storage the dietaries all these things are weird clubbing together as computing but when you do computing and your system depends a legion ance system or or your identity sister marier your great management sister or your property registration system the depending on her horse computing ecosystem so but then you for depending on the computer ecosystem there are many different possibilities by which the tar in all in that ecosystem can be imparted and er and tempered with and a bed by little transliterating to the network bed while this in storage but wiltering computed so therefore we have to worry about trust it computing way you can trust be computing environment to produce result he the integrity of the result and there give me transparency of how it is a professing the data how it is storing the detain how it is protecting the data against various kind of attacks and that is what blockin can give you and as attractive properties of lock in for this purpose is that it gives you a temper proof log of data with authentication which means that the data also resigned by wavered that tater and then it it is immutable or almost immutable so which mass that once written it is cartographical very competition ly hurried to remove that long
