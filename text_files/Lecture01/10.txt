to tamper with the law and if you want the transparency but not level be private information you can do that in the lock gently it can you can make it privacy preserving and it provides a basis for trust it computing on top of which application can be built for liptaka little bit about when he said trust a what i mean by trust so trust models that you assume in face of some petting environment we have to consider what at the trusted of the er opposite your attack model like woinak or how he treated like what are the threats to the integrity and privacy and a viability of the information so first of all you can put your trust in the hard way and say that he were not lick your reproach but is that true as it is not necessarily true because there is something concision attacks to which people have shown that they can actually get your topography key while you are doing in ruption or your doing detrition they can look at the power that you drawing from the your power in now a source or the kannot the necromantic signature or taken look at the timing and all kind of things by which they have shown that they can revelatory so unless you are hard ware is in a proof to that kind of manipulation you're hadramaut be trustworthy so now a days there is a lot of work on how to make a hard wirework me by using on slaves and another kind of mechanisms and even there we have people of shone there was to sivert be protections that be had recombines come up with you must have heard of her in tells the milltown and spectre bugs that came out to years ago so so you may mayn't be able to trust the hard way so in that case if you don't rest your haggy of to me sure that you do the protection against any kind of keeking and a letter at the next layer which is the operator them let her farm where lay and there the question is now operate as times basically create processes and they have memory in which the computational results and stuff aimery kept and this remember is also heretical such masses some of part of the memory addresses sometimes come to the cashiers and and all that stuff up ends so therefore the question is other ways in which your people can pick into your castor picking to your memory and then look a getreide information your private key and all that stuff for that hat that is another question of trust now if you are you are using battalions then you have to know whether you're hyper viser lexington they can break into your process memory and all that stuff and then her applications may be how so have bugs and they may be sabretache and why application is using some of your data it may actually temper with that or it may actually be viler privates and all the stuff if you application is using your private key without any protection so the question is what is your trust in car it is it in the hard way or is it in the princes to him is it in the plication or you cross the manufacture like interets to actually give you a trusted platform be but in case of the application layonne and and you know retaliate my batter be question is due trust the banks that that they're not taking away small amount from your balance all the time there's a movie caloric space that was taking only a you know fraction of a cent from a retention and very soon they who accumulated means i do would crush the land record department to keep the integrity of the landed court to trust the idea officials ah to keep your other detaches logs are you know in in integrity of that you trust your local system and mysteries to not to go around your back and change your data read your data and then would be let all that information from the system log if you have a patch management system in your enterprise all how you know that the paths being mad or somebody is doing a onorata to attack your sister and things like that so that those are the problems that you have to worry about so so far we have spoken about the trust model and parsoning threat model which are kind of inverse of each other now let's look at some of the cases that we talked about before i
