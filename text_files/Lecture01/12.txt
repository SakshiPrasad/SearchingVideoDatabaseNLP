in what we need to know where that point came from from which transaction to her to go and see the next reduction in the finally tell we are transaction when the coin was created right so this history has to be kept and this history now that did a structure in which you keep the history and all that stuff is a matter of detail like but the main question is who keeps track of the transaction history the hotels me that somebody is trying to do it able spending and then if i have done at able bending to a given the point to two people who are besides who actually gets the money and who is that one who is not going to get the money and so which was that somebody has to tell me which one is a valuation is when is not valiant so conceptually her would be that there in that has been used in the transaction is a valid transaction also it not already consumed and the total value out of the inaction should be total valois have multiple coin from multiple sources like an use that in one transaction because not everything has the balloon coin so i can get three different wants to buy a thing what of three points but then the total valuing and velut should be the same and then i should be signed by the wooers of all that consume coins it so this is the west mamertine so that his tree that you saw has to be off validation right so so somebody has rejected validity of the transaction and somebody has to use the history to tell me with her double meaning is being done so now how do you actually made in the clients with a you make the point in mutable and all this is a detail in not where about it at this point so the cushites ion is who maintains the history and who were elided the transactions and who tells me that the disbelieves there is a double spinning so one possible solution of course he is having a trusted her party right so an i won't you have just a herbert we are back to the same conventional problem that i i have a third rested her party he maintained me leger of transactions and he checks console lager every time and quite is trying to be used in a transaction to ensure that they this is a valid transaction and oh what but the question is should we trust they trust it her party the true head where my be a biased in tidy and they might actually honors are wired in favor of some people and are a witigis some people so it's defeatures of a distributed consents makani and all that and that's where we got in base solution comes into play so trusted her bodice not art referable solution because that's a lusion alreadie being used to day but we want to remove the trustiest and created trust system in which we can transact trusting the system not trusting a single entity so that the about that coeoperate i should now back to the applicant story re soyo have the ice came factory you have the delivery truck and you of the restaurant and this question was that who is melting the stream with a sad batterymen its supplies it to the truck of the truck the is actually keeping it the very itinerate in the i crimes melting so let's see what solutions so be question is here is about you know supplicatingly and when i get meletia i ask questions to both of them and what of them point fingers at each other so as i said a liar that i could put in a out or intent of things a type of a censor in each of these places in the factory and in the in the truck and i can see that said me your temperature every second or every thirty seconds and i will keep track of your temperature where you store and i will actually decide who is responsible for this however there multiple problem that can occur so i let talk about what can be won first of all if you do not think other than just i make these idiotic as send information then they foison is not in prepared and the tally signed then somebody are canteen in the middle attack so they can actually intercept the message change it so maybe the company be we try to do that to
