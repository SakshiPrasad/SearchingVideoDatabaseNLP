et in light of what we have discussed a since then so let's first look at how one can create a digital coin and this is a wintered o gin version one so what you can do you can say that i am going to be your meant and i am going to create a digital coin and then i'll give it a quaint idea and then i will have a public and private key and i resign the coin with my privately okay sir anybody who has a my public because public is are usually not to everybody else so he can check tait is my signature and want it as my signature is valid coin so then so i can then give the kine to somebody else maybe we are in in exchange of some value in now in the real worse like i by a book from him in then i give it to a friend so great to a friend the friend pleasant public and private key and i give the friend i say that way to his public i address this equine and i signed it with my private key said he where can check with her i signed it by using my public and i i also nodded to keep the history of how this coin was created and who gave it to whom i created a link to the previous information that the coin was created by me so this red like that your singer is actually that linked that his skipping that his tree along now since i have now the point i earned by giving your book or something elinor book so now i want to give it to aino now gives me something like maybe another book as i want to give the money to armenia that way to a wine public address publicly and then i signed it right and i'm the friend so i signed it and then i keep a link to the previous to previous link to information presentation so anybody wants to check where this point came from then he has to basically go down the links and see where the coin was created who got it first and who got its second and so on so this is what so i retipation all this information is also passed about the quintet so all we know on the quaint but if i am dishonest what i can do since this is digitals have no problem or to pass it on to my table people so i actually give a copy to revile and the friend for another thing that i get from him and do the same linking and allan the question is i had only one coin now i have give it to two people not this to people will have to you know but er the same clan that is not possible right because if you are a neeld can then you could not have given to two people since you are earl disheartening and pasting so you can actually give it to two people and this is what is called it double spending so i have done at the bleeding which cannot be done her real money maitresse because then i you if i can to double spending i can to triple when he and then the value i got from this one coin is trice there value right beacon something from harrington something some ay but i'm just giving them the same thing and they also when the trio use it they will bear it will be a problem so this is called it double spending or a sense eetaly an attack colleton at that so majorcan has always been in the digital carency to eighty people have been trying to solve this problem of prating digital money and this man all these people have come to this problem that owosso double spending and if you can do double spending you can do triple couple all all kind of finding so we have to do something more than what we just showed you in the worsen so worsens how he can make a double wending proof this it alkaline so what we what had been did is that saying that ah we create a history of all the transactions so are we won't you are giving the coin to somebody we were not giving any number to it right so we were just her collecting them through this ling now we say that will have williston actions and each transaction will basically bend one
