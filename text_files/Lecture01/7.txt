then under the competition that was done to stood that data and any other competition that was done to store date subsequent to that so this is a total amount of work competition work that combines to do to tamper with but if i have majority of the competing power in the entire consiste then i can actually completely change the entire jane jane of date on all that the day i want to change and all subsequent later now think about this life one country were his most of these are majority of this companies who are doing betkin mining if they want to get together and then they are to all competition power becomes above fifty one per cent then with quin will have no integrity of its sensuous and therefore the interist wi fate also because of this environmental concerns and politely of the tripolitan so on we may be that the country in which all this companies are there and then doing power they are polluting the warment country might decide that they wearily activities of this companies and therefore there were another kind of problem and when this kind of news is come you will see the wit contrives fall the reason is even though it may be a speculative news but because because we are not dependent on all this difference extraneous things which are not imagined by the originator of the witan and gentry of the bit converse an anonymous person who used the name sauceboat and into tousan nine he wrote the first nukerton of the bit quin and he launched it and he also wrote a white paper and his idea was to get rid of the tyranny large banks right out into the the mate there was a international financial well down and it turned out that the banks did a lot of things which are not properly cured you know correcting to do and in fact from the writing and from the ordinances that was in the first lock of the big pine locked came it seems like he was actually trying to emancipate people from there as from the hold of the banks and then they were one to interworld everybody to become part of a carentem which is not dependent on a central banks or on the banks to actually decide the you know the value of the pro money but unfortunately a way were out and away way and full that is that i only i'll hand full of temples and now doing most of the big kind mining and then the all the transactions that happening her also were by only a you know will want to percent of the people who are involving the bit conquest and the same thing is happening in atrium that ninety per cent of the transactions are done by maybe hundred players when there are about six million lairs in the koester so you can see that there is a huge amount of inequality that is building up in that to her ancester when the only handful of players who are doing all their hivites all the transactions storing all the all the rarities and the rest of the other people are doing the little and therefore be an interim of the totonac motor whoever it is is not being translated to reality so that's another problem and as you know that in india there be i has a putter bandana bannon with coin as a transaction a medium and a orangine of crioceris and there is a good reason for that and will not get into that but that is how it is so ah then versate problem that this problem has been happening because of various resents that subcommittee subit coin if you are wont to directly plain to the bit canister do mining do transactions you have you have to be competition ally save right you have to know how to create a private key how to create a public how to tell other people that this is my public y which which basically get shot in to her your villettes and then you have to store their private every very securely in order to so that nobody knows your private because one you know one the know your private key the money is no longer yours because they can use your private kato spend the money or transfer the money to another account
