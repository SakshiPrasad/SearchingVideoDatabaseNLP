the seas come to the block in technology and application course i'm proposes in the hour carrom miration pool and i'll biteing the course so ah this course the material on lockit days quite commonly available at various sir you now universities and various seconder lectures and so on so i must acknowledge my different colleges from various universities whose lectures and whose material and books i have used to prepare the matelot discourse so what is a block chinfeather generally a block in his minglest so what is a lineless all of you know that a lineless is a set of locks which are connected to each other by some kind of a link in case of a detractor liked less you have the notes and notes are connected by pointers and pointers are basically memory addresses but in case of a block jane the block james a distributed it structure which is repeated at various notes or various computers and therefore the lining is not based on memory addresses so we have a different notion of linking between notes and each of these notes a complex so therefore are you can imagine a block can as a cities of blocks and each go is connected bark which previous lock by some kind of a link so ah and it is replicated all over because replication gives you a number of different advantages like ah if one of the replica gets corrupted the other replicas of there to a measure that the integrity of the information contained in the in the detractor is maintained and also replication give you some kind of guarantee of integrity of data and it is distributed in the sense that a bee the different computers involved in the locomotor actually are running distributed algorithms in order to maintain the dates consistency and integrating and the consistency of the data is maintained by a process called consensus a consensus means that everybody agrees that we date the casino the deestract ure i is what they agreed to put there and the lining as i said before traditional lineless blinking his remember addresses but in this case we cannot use memory at dresses for lining for there is a cryptographic technique called hashing so we actually use something collating and integrity of the data is maintained and because of rhetoric techniques and consensus and replication therefore blocking is a better structure that is maintained distributed ly and that is replicated and mean partes of latin is to maintain the integrity of the data and what is the integrity integrity means that the data wants it has been agreed by all the relevant parties to put in the decatur it has not been tampered with it nobody has come and changed the data and and claimed that this is the date that was wotan that is made buttresses ineloquent remain a property of the boccanera maintained the integrity of the data nasica that most of that plications who are locked in his use beat grippers or beat some other application the integrity of the data is he maintain in lockets what is docteer so first of all you know many times we keep logs of human rights so when somebody accesses your computer the computer gives a log of bruser names and and how they authenticate themselves for microsoft windows give event logs every event that happens like your opener a new program on on your machine or a something crashes or any any kind of even or you know it you can't get connected to the internet all his events are kept in even logs so logs are very important when you do bank in transaction bank kips logs of a when you are interacted with its
