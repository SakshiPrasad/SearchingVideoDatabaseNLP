and a gulf leg this thievin this gulf before they have seen this inward discussing the creep and the triple lax creepily stated so this is your behaviour of your place the typical response of the scholastic material now i have only broken up so quick point before a week we draw in poland an important conclusion and that is i've only broken it up into two different signals here but you are are many different multitude you can break this signal up in this fashion in many ways and the supervision of separate as pansies to hold must hold for all the different cases that you can envies must i descend that what i am growing here you just examples but it it must hold for all different cases so now we can't we will say that if if a maderista word lenity of kali and superbaton of separateness for an histories then responses said to be dentist important predatory also noted that there is no fundamental law that required a genetic material to obey either nina skilly all superbaton of the sponsors suppuration apertures or boat obviously there is no law it require it to hold for the either one that it is in more impossible that son to hold for one so this is a very important idea and we can see that if a medial has to be having a nomination mad has many different ways in which it can be have so we already saw that the lenity of scaling can have at least two different aspects and were this a tical stress above which it behaves as a nominal or no idea the also of application of the stress about on below which it can no bilingual no the obvious question at this stage is that if metilius so why are we thing why is this question of supervision arising is i as a mediator have memory it so if the medes have memory can we can ask them that they might hold information about the creation also how they are made
