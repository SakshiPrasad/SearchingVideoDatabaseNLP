that is the case then you might have an age that you can a suite with the ideal when it was created this one more point which is in all our previous discussion the members are many will we are discussing all these different grafts except what we are always as huming is that when you are applying our haddon a stress allows for no more strain to the material the middies in some native for orion some tit existence some data condition such that there is no previous stress history that it remembers the because if they is a prius tresanti that it is remembering then that would also come into picture here so when we see the cold zero we are as you ring that the medes stress free a stranger is no residual stress in the meerest material does not have any age you can just come in and take the manyema be its sling on your experimental shelf and his eyes start bring that experiment that is another very important condition so so here our question is i may pick ishtar is whether the equal to zero can be chosen or with really or not so we are dry to wonder if materials have memory can they also age so there is again no one fundamental law that says that they cannot eat but we want to sell economies are we want to work it mathias whose response step stress does not depend on when the experiment is a so we want to choose what we want to do is we want to perform the experiment settat the gold o the lot can be a wireless madison have should not possess the sideless from previous experiments at its microstoma should not be changing at the function of timetes onotoa hold to so there are many medias forwith this may a man at holloaed this proposition the dishonor have a maid of the previous in a sense a few years life they should not remember or lesion order were wenerated this is something that you can only be torn from an experiment whether this is true or not so that you can see to simply go and will discuss so let us say you are in the lab i will draw and discovery we like simple he had a so let us say the saiga so the time assesses absolute
