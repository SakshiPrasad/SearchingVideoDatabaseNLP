and you have you your import any sally that ignorance and the nature and jump to another value this well you know i i my to it some time flee one a this din bethought of as being equivalent to two cases a heretofore a gray internationally make it in many ways but one of the ways in which you can break of the import is that you have an import of sigma one for all times and then it suddenly time to want you are by another sin in put signal it is all signed one again so if i were or draw the responses the response to my gag on the left inside then canisters one of the retentive will also be gelent to the two separateness i ride together simply that is what the sensible person of responses is asking you so this is import men who are to do asking you is whether a just again draw it three four absinthe first case you have them put to the signal signal so this is our jacomo signal on it and in the second case is the quickly go back i may be are lisele this so we receive that the second signal is sigmaringen and this being applied at the time to one i so tilton what is your response is gone visit we discuss that point i let me that so this is a tea one sir now you are a have a new response so that as false to the separate function is simply de signatories common the minute one sorry i think i i clipped it this is a silly do you mind us do want sig my boot myles said maman so what do a question of supervision of the sponsers is very simple it is saying that if this very original imperially the one in the little inside then can i simply add this to signals on my right hand side and get the response to this mood complicated signal so your galileo something like you have the and then then we break and then the you'd have this other toscani in this not and this is your rein so so parishioner superrational superposes says that no matter what kind of a complicated input signal you might wish to provide if you break it up into its constituents are other recitin separate signals then the final output is just a sum
