in southeastern alias so we come back to the cars but this is elected about so to day will discuss about the second or the linear defecation because in the last lecture we are doroteita fashoda lena and the now lena defendin question so in this lecture we are going to start moving farther to the second order liner defenceless so let chepeside discuss a second order lena deferential equation so i the dorinda question is this cold while you would be quarles even eggs do you a b dear lass it to arks did it works why why x is a cold go saw here i'm talking bout homogeneous forms for this is a homogeneous now i am defining this one in where my explane to some interval so this into just take and the opening to all but when a fine bit so i sum that here is noticed so i divide why in order disois he questioned reduced to one a cover in order the while by the s lus et to exoriare why e e called so i just make it give a new name so this equation i can right as this city over de quar plus sigehelm to this one so that i perterritus why i could to you so the emmy question i call it one so in this case i assume that so this equation has solution if my peers and cuantos in the given to men that is my ex blond to open into well and arbiter notion so now so this equation if we choose some initial condition why at etna is goldwin and why dare shed a note is a cult why not dash then then so i call it one be then that initial welbore the is one a and one by his young solution in the gondomar that is within a friend we tar and and if we choose homogeneous initial condition or a annihilated is why at a note could be girand why there at exadius then
