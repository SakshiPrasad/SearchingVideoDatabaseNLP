along the major assumptions that we had before we started is that as there are no roy changes meaning we don't swap the rows of materia or a prime a in the process of doing onorato meaning we do not have a zero pure now what would happen if you have a european can you still write as a priest of a loedinger and offer trinacria won't be a guess if you had to swap some of the rows in the process of guelegaan could you still write as a product of a loy trying of her trying to matrix just a while guest a man you say yes very few you kane great appreciate it so will see that you can in fact right the air sir product of helotry opper trying metis matrices even if you have to swap some of the rods of a in the process of gossoon okay at all were going to do now that i steinart though the question is what happens if we have read scenes this means use lap the rose of the matrix imitating equation so that you don't have a zero okay now he say ah a generic and by an maresfield there atene ah that is known as partial pivoting that is commonly employed when you wanted to rechanged okay the suppose you start with this matrix suppers you figured out that a one one was zero and what would you do you will swap the first row with any other rose as that the first entry is nonsuit because you don't want the pirit to be azinte now what partial pivoting does hers in the first separating elation you compare all these values right and you pick the value with the largest a magnitude a lily than the absolute value of all these numbers and check which one has to largent take that roe and swept the first throw and the robelot ter element in the first position okay this is partial riveting okay now you may ask why you may want to pick the entry with the largest the magnitude to be your first piet okay the reason why you do that is because if you remember coinage operations and gusman we divided by the pietrie so we won't make sure that when we divide by the period we do not have lots of wrongdoers right if you divide by really small number you know that you will have wrongdoers and this'll be magnified as you keep er continuing the gosain so when you ensure that the number here which is the pure is going to have a largest magnitude then you you you don't have to worry about wrongdoers or because of division by a small amber right so that is partiality and you keep repeating this at every stage you gustation right sir after your complete the first date you look at the submarine then you pick the element with the largest magnitude here and swap the second room and the corresponding rother gas you keep doing that at every stage you get to what is not a partiality okay is a very important computation technique and the reason why you do that is as i mention is because you want a void a wrong of eros getting magnified okay
