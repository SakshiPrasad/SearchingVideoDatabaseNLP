now let's say that you do certain swapping meaning certain formations of the rose in the process hoseason a how do we incorporate this process as as a matrix operation is there any merit that would there correspond to swapping the rows of matrix eight cats so they say colocasia matrix a two right to make ricini take this may tree which is nothing but the two by your identity may trick with the rose into change right to normal you have a one zero anser one i have interchanged the road now let's see what happens sanditon quickly like magic but very simple what happens is the rose of a or interchange exactly the same way as he rose in the material multiplies it right akushichi here is called apominations materiae soliform much the rose of may reach eight and remember that we are multiplying a on the less inside by this matrix and want a plying on the less enide corresponding to manila the rows of merit and what a plying on the ringside would correspond to manipulating the column to be come to that later but if this dearie this very simple example i have swapped the rose of the intimate ricks the first and the second rose and men amusable by a matrix at the rose the matrix able also we topped a canow a formation may break is nothing but the ice may trenwith its rolls re ordered to know you take the one may fix you re order the rose right then what you will get it not as a permeation mad tricks it's the simple example shows you the same now how can we incorporate the permittin made breaks into gushington it's very simple we started with the matrix a right the very first step you want to do is to check if a one one is the right in other words you also do partial evading or what we want to do as we want to compare the magnitude of all these guys and picked the role with the largest magnitude and eustacie should first rise so you might have to permit at the very first the gas which means you may have to multiply a by p one you and before you multiply the permuted may fix ye see one right there an see that you take a permeters suitably and then well supplied by the one right you get to me for a prime now now you may have to permit this may reagan right and then at supplied by sea to do it is not always true that you have to permute right you don't have to for you all the time if that is a gazogene simply pick the curse on in permittin made rick to be the identity matri which does nothing okay now you keep repeating this so you will get to pen minus one he and mine i want right and that will you as an upper trying limiting all the permittin made receive where i enter mad to see what is that mean we never have to permute right then he is equally because we know that he one scusate at that rain when we take the inverse they take up a nice lord triangular structure right but now the problem is this guy peon who sneaks in between right see there's a ponteneuson between a and c one there's a
