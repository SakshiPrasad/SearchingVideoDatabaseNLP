medical annals so one mechanical a log that we wanted the curses the spring at the spring is a construe that we are play quite often in mechanics where we know that a spring when it is an equal beeas not exert any force but when it does disturbed from equilibrizer as a storing force on a mass of warring ah if it is a lines spring then there is the force that is storing force that it applies is equal to this proportional to the displacement from equilibrio the pig the other is the dash port some people call it dampened is also represented by this symbol the dash for is usually use is it another contract which is used to signify dissipation and mechanics with so here the dissipation is proportional to the velocity so let us see whether so we have been looking at at a disquieting back to this a especes till now we have been so we have been looking at one dimensional viscous igspose vierick as the combination of elastic solid and this cussed lodestones ah so let us see how a weingarten analogy a so see i look what i would do is this i would to break up this page into to have a wee lot of space yet so let us look at our responds and let us see if our analogue to water so the forest wastes that as pontefract exiled said why what we had is let's say we are looking at one dimension solitary get rod of length and lot and you are playhouses it and this was all in a defamation and this deformed state the land has not increased and it is given by one possible with silin is strains similarly in our analog a system we have a spring that it initially at some unnoticed or an ode a equilibrium let then you apply a force to the spring when you are by the force the spring be forms an now becomes it tell by s the excess standing for the spring as in case of the solid we know that we have the stress of the stream which are legally related to each other and there given and this vanessa is carters were less in bull proportional relationship it will sag mine upsilon and the same is the case for one spring where we have this restoring force which is a function the displacement and this so gives information about
