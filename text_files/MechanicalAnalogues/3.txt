spring on and right so which implies their so if you tried a draggletailed what we are implying is that this stress in our sister is analogus to the force in mechanics suthin along to force and your displacement then becomes analogus to the string so that relationship so permits go work to this side so in this case in the case of the elastic body we had this license i know we can see say that this relationship is analogus an you straight consistent so ill use the same color so your force is equal to katie then to excess so this equation now the entire question his becomes or mechanics mechanical analogue to the elastic sort so similarly if we go a for the wiscasset as a sicarii body what we see that there is that the relationship we had so far of fluid we said that anais dissipated and befalling the license woodstall ing relationship is it mark people to multomah so if we want to use the despot as at a log for the fur viscidities in a fluid then here your equation we now be some mutines delta x that we call it the a e d which is the displacement of the dash board by the daughter presents the time the heirs these two questions are important because what the makers realise is that if the elastic morgan be considered in a log esto a spring and if the fiscus fruit can be considered analogous to a dash port then the viscounties was can we consider the same linen combination of the spring and the dash potentates in defeat to their many different many models which use these two analogues in the use this to analogues to bust the this caustic a precious calastia pons so the spring and the shotwell be used to understand this galactic responds and build the scholastic models now we must pay for her the madeleine is not made of the spring and ashpot they're just imaginary constructs that we can use to model of his coastin response so tis not the material itself is the use that to a light is not composed of springs
