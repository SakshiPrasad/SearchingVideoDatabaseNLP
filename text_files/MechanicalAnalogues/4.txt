and as what there's simply constructs so ah so hard we wandered as if in city at some point we will the present and this corsican the tom lilia combination then is drawing some possibilities he can have even more complicated than arius isot of cramped for space to substantiam agaric of the continuum responses of a viscous tic body we can be different models by putting the spring on the dashboard in some in combination and i just given you three different examples here in which the windomville ways and these can all the present differently scholastical responses a a the matter medical details of these responses will see it slightly later stage but what we are going to do is sadly and a log a letter and going to help us will continue level models for the scholastic city so before we sort of end our discussion on that aloetic north that these analogues jam armenteros antium novel or backropes big leontes the cart model or they do not have any information about the microscopic details of the median so they cannot provide and the heralds they cannot they cannot provide microscopic or moriturus kin information about the medersa what we have done the love we figured out that there are two analogues of the elastic for the last excess one either through response we can use to different analogues to model such responses and most like we it be able to use a line communicate give us some good models for the scholastici the dites of that in matematica tensely at a still later stage so we are also we also formularies of different continuations is like the creepers considerate stress relaciones posit so let us take some oh let us do some example problems where we get to analyze this little refuter so one example problem that i have prepared for you is situation where you apply the step stressed as
