i and you expert when do i retain the stress relaxation function looked something like this where this is given by the skill misgiven by so i ate by lambert ah now your question is so this is a given system so there is a maillane done that teeny experimentally determined that this is not this information is given to you that the g t is simply exponentially decking function the question is that is being posed for you is that this same ideal is now going to be subjected to a strain where the strain is full a duration of one time time the taiko one the stars one there are buried in crises to a value of two so this value here is too when it remains at two till decalet after which dick rises to a valor misson and remain at an eel of minus one till then that he of one and that time the cold titre it becomes her so your question is for the same history shone on the left find out what is the stress history are the meditations of the question that there is a mairitch is given to you the mediation is one dishonor you and this is given to a strap strangest and at the same rates being subjected to this strain history which is drawn on on the left and you'll be asked to find out the stressed for this case so we stop herode and we will continue to see ah then he next class what will see it will work out a solution to this particles and a couple of more examples problems okay so what we learn in to day's lecture was we looked at eating materials and we went over that defies within a knowledge mehemet with ye and then we saw that the elastic body the classical elastic and the classical viscus flewed behavior allows to use two constructs the spring and the dashboard to model the macacoes pons of his colossi materials and then we are working out this example problem and will see the solution in the next class for this so ill and at classes
