and in form of the gaffs but at least you can see that the intercepts of these are different in diet of one into supertonic v to the different so this material which is given my discourse or so these three curves these curves suggests that the materialist rupture my troth structure is but was a bit ending over time the different in deserts intercepts suggest that initially the maderist soft material is a much soft and is sort of fluid like suiting his fled like and is slowly curling over time as so insecticides in me made which are aging so in eighteen made the time when the meditated often collective of creation of the metal became very important relative to when you are doing the experiment so in aging materials you have to in aiding materials the time of creation the late g experimentation times some the then time becomes important so as i scolded before that there is no fundamental law that requires a medea to be eating or on ages whenever you have a midden it is for you to determine whether you determine petatone pediment ally whether the aging process is any taking place or not we will mostly concern ourselves with now edging materials except perhaps in a few simple problems he had and that but now you now know that the important concepts that are in volendam the line regolati idea would also have the idea of non aging mites o the made leash uld be the same over time so when we are discussing the scales deity with discuss that viscounties pons is that a man that is intermediate too to classical responses the first articles was is it of a inelastic solid and the second is that of it this cold sleet no and we had done that we had looked at various graphical representation of how the fiscales response and the two classicalist responses look like it we looked since we looked at the garita responds to is another important cue that we did not discuss at that point and that was an analogy with mechanics that i like discuss right now so what do i mean when i say analogical is that we did this cuss gavial representations but is there any thing in megalith reminders of a arouses the discussions on could be a fonscol be some combination of those
