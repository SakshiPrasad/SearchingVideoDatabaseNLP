a lot when i talk about is does touch matter insides from happy research in marketing first i want explain with happy is have dick comes from the greek word and it means able to lay hold of basically think about it is touching with the hands and he may think of well why do we care about captain marketing if you think about the growth of online shopping or catalogue shopping it's really important to understand why people are so mormonite to touch an all theirs and how do we compensate for an inability to touch so i want to talk about a framework i want to start with object or products actors that encouraged touch and then an individual difference factor and then situation factors that may motivate touch and then a little bit about compensation mechanism touches better than any other sons at four different attributes and those include texture hardness waiting ter peter so for texture during a be motivated to touch this or clothing for hardness if you think about a cellphone you may want to press the buttons and see how they feel prior to purchase electronic quipment to people like to see how the buttons respond when we also have wait you and to see how waiteth heavy it is how easy it is to carry and in finally temperature telfer buying a beverage you may want to feel different beverages to feel the coldest one in the refrigerator what's really interesting about touch there is some people in cognitive psychology that have discute studied touch also and what they look at is people's hand movements so for each of those objects properties the stereotype hand movements you can observe as their ascertaining that information so for example texture if you watch people trying to ascertain texture they will do this lateral motion all rub like this or the ruble this in one study i vidette people veining products and time their different hand movements so each of these four attributes have different handles so we have texture for hardness you can see them precise can see people put pushing the buttons basically for way unsupported holding you can see him half thing the object and then finally for temperature static contact you can just see them laying their hands on the different objects so it's i a happy perceptual system is really interesting case is the only system where you can observe input to the system by observing him movement so if a producat or veriest attributes you're going to be much more vonved to touch than if it does it so for example like books they don't really vary in a diagnostic lay on one was after blent really care about touching compared to something like claws or sporting or cue equipment or something else that does so products of varying people also vary and how motivated they are to touch so few watch people in stores which i've done a lot and you look at their touching the haviour thurso people no matter what category there and they touch everything while other people don't really seem to care if they touch her not so there is as individual difference what i i turn need for touch and people's preference for touch information so you have the product you have the people then situation differences so online callaghan i mentioned that you can't touch prior to purchase in one study i went to a grocery store and i can hid behind your trition signs why watch people shop and i looked at you know what categories they purchased in a time how long they touched which categories they touched one thing that i found is if you put up a point of her to sign encouraging touch you get significantly more impulse on planeting for high and lone for touch people but especially these high need for touch people so you can change things in the situation and motivate people to touch even more so you have the product you had the individual and you have the situation all factors but let's say you know you buy something like this blanket on line well this you would say well okay it's thought texture you could feel this latter motion wait unsupported holding is a prodigate gory that you probably want to touch and let's say your high need for touch why would you buy something less like that on line well could be that there's some compensation mechanism so for example there's some written description where you know you'll really need to touch it because you can just read the written description so there can be written to scription there could be a visual there could be a low price or could be a return policy some way to compensate for an inability to touch so does touch manner i would say sometimes it just depends on the product and the person and situation the
