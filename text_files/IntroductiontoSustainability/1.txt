carry on with their lives how would we survive that is what is keeping us worried with so much of flemishing happening so many of names and cyclones and earth was the intensity as well as the frequency increasing there is more and more damage to human life and the worrit that only it is not a damage only to female it is a damage to all other life forms as well but we are worried about our own existence and that is the reason we are talking about solutions which are sustainable which will continue to go on and he very slowly now that what we are doing is not sustainable it cannot sustain for a longer period so the question is what sustains this is an image of an abandoned fishing village in russia which has been left on its own and he can retells what sustained the only thing that sustains your is nature nature or stains itself anything that is left to nature will sustain will grow on its own and its free form and as humans we have very clearly understood that it is only nature which can sustain itself none of the artificial human maid development or structures will survive or sustain if it does not follow nature and who are we when the talking about nature as a separate entity and we human beings are able to create something which is not nature isn't there a conflict with talking about identifying our own self and that's the question who are we we are part of nature we are an integral part of nature and a very small part of that nature which has covenant thousands of other life forms lance animals where i tisanes of them we are just one small portion of that but we have made ourselves so dominant that we think that weak and take care or take over west of the life forms and the nature around us but essentially we are an integral part of that nature we are the nature itself the moment we detach a sales are bitin my men are buildings are image surroundings and environment from nature is well this problem comes from where the entire problem of the tenability of not sustaining convent to picture long back when human identified himself as part of the nature this problem did not arise so when we say that an only thing the only thing would sustain is nature so they have to abide by the rules of the nature and there are very clothespin and identified rules of the nature these are interdependence efficiency survivors and change for four let's look at the rule of interdependence anything in nature follows the essential rule of inter dependence nothing in this nature is independent everything for its survivors require the presence of other beings around it they may be like forms or they may not be the life forms but we require them and there is an interdependence it's not that one is dependent on the other is always a mutual thing for our food for our life for our sustains we require all these other forms if we realize that and with her life that no individual can probably survive but it is only a community and different communities together an entire equal system which will hellenists and survive is then we will be able to create these systems which are interdependent in nature the ways from one is always a useful product to the other or there are systems in
