yet it's a tis because you're after or the same resource which is required to construct that her heart will be added replace replenished or it will be reformed however if you look at a very robust fort where the kind of material which has gone in cannot be replenished or replaced every year year after year it cannot be recreated so there are different strategy to how systems sustain one of them being the rule of treasure the last but one of the most important rules of nature of the staining is the rule of change anything which adapt itself and was changes with time the context and de requirements is more likely to survive and sustain if we don't change if we don't avail so the issuer common and established theory of adaptation you can read more from the sling on adaptation so this is from nature but when they adopt when we change to be given context and succumstances situations is when we are more likely to sustain to survive the unset which we will looking for was who are we and the answer to that was the art part of the nature and early human beings very clearly understood that realised that they were part of the nature and hence the living the way they lived was integrally connected derived from nature and be renidet have problems for if you look at native tribes from all over the world in different limit in jones ingredients which have different resources of arable with them we see how he wants were integrally connected to nature for example the strife in the tropical part of the world the kind of clothing they have the kind of residence is the kind of hat that they have at direction ding to the nature around them if we look at some of the warmer ages the responses are very very similar how they respond to the reins her rings which are there how they respond to the hilly takern forest which is around them the responses are contexture that is what all her human beings across the world were doing if you look at the coleridges the way they covered themselves the kind of resources that they use wouldn't load and mechanise to keep themselves warm all common there similar the responses in turns of architecture the response of in terms of their food habits the responses in terms of our clothing there on very very similar and this is simply the flitting the basic fundamental that humans were very connected with nature and that is the reason we survived the service very efficiently not each of the rest that the eskimos a wearing requires or most and er and half to make itself but they don't have it eskimos and have many dresses this fluffy suit that the wearing they don't have many of them the realise the importance it is procured from one of the renders which die of which the meat is taken as a food the fat is taken as or of fuel to light their homes to keep themselves warm inside their homes so each of the lie for a resource which is available around is not wasted it is interdependent but even when it is available in abundance it is not abused it is used and it is efficiently whose so there is efficiency and it as they have adapted adapted themselves or were tying the realized that they have several around them this is how they adopt to the surroundings adapted to their context look at any response of these only human beings and we see that they have special secures force to the context in which they apace looking at any of these pictures that i have just shown you we can very clearly identify that this is a picture from her or native tribe living
