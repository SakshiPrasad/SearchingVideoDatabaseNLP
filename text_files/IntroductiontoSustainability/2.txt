to which dick care of that waste and nothing is actually away all our systems have to realise that and for such interdependences to where nothing is a by product or a way and everything is within a soul and you dallied by the other system it is an interdependence system the next in visual of efficiency anything that survives in me nature is highly efficient by what you of its design by word you of the way it consumes reaches and produce of this or by foutah are of course useful to the other anything that flourishes and survives sustains is efficient however we as humans are not to water about efficiency many a times are systems are highly inefficient they eat up the take up a lot of resources like an orgy water air and in tone folloman produce the intended result in an efficient manner this is the rule of efficiency that we are talking about we look at any design in nature anything that has survived or sustain itself is highly efficient and the one which was not haskalah and has been taken over by other systems we by what you of the intelligence that we possess all the power that we have we may are inefficient system run for long but in the long run they can not subtend that is what we realizing gradually transportation systems which are inefficient are gradually being replaced constructions systems which are inefficient are gradually being repeated and deodorize the problems or issues arising out of inefficiency when we have a greater demand and less of the supply as long as there is less of demand and amphius me would not realize the problem of this inefficiency arising much looking at the world to day we have huge forelaid gloveson and we have wilkie so many resources to fulfill the needs of the population that in war we realize that every system has to be efficient so from my crow scale my colliver beings things around us in nature to the marrow on such as reality self every thing by which offered designed formed consumption of resources it is efficient next is the rule of the rival so it is always this survival of the fittest it not that a sister have to be efficient or interdependent they have to be strong they have to be robert to survive that test of time we can not create fragilest and expect them to sustain the systems have to be rubes however when we come and we look at examples of what sustains mieao come across systems with a week of fragile but they have different mechanisms to survive for example here we look at once tissue which is strong very strong so there is less of that of spring less appelation because it will be able to survive itself they with other very strong or over species thing with very strong efficient systems they don't need a larger or giggle number to survive or sustain however if we look at systems or species which are weak we can not so strong there they would require some of the mechanism for example here the mechanism is large population because the large number of these this space were actually be eaten up taaoa a food as food by other species which are most stronger and have less a population so in the end it is a balance there will still survive what by virtue of something else for example if we looking at architecture synonym me have a hat which consumes lessees for example the dried wood and leaves and touch by that it consumes lesson of tears it is a fragile but
