my operators they soaked the sale at the palace bought of the fort was also the palace for the net the king in tone in kind of distress when there was a war being raged against the kingdom the people were given for tection in this fort which was then another purpose at times the footsore as cities which were like wisit to suppose you look at the jessamine was particulate entire city for in those times in those or contests they were contractual and hence they were able to sustain into daytimes as the fortuitous has changed we cannot get the unwomanly economic and social resource which is required to create a bilingual on other forts for the same reason cannot be constructed and that his wife see that into this time we do not construct this fort they are socially culturally absolute and they are so resource in tenses that we just cannot think of building that however this kind of a building where it is less to resource consuming can tell continue however we still see that a lot of wholly art is not being done these days or their are or ever towards revival of these art forms this creative forms but yet because there is a significant man power which is required it is declining where e there is a lot of resource and unction of either type it is difficult to fostina unless there is a focal partial context which keeps it going poised it that impetus to moan to substance so we see that yes i dearly it would sustainest because this it requires significant man power and skill it is difficult to sustain this activity can be created another torment we can not it's not that we do not have the required or skill or designers who can design a pasha we are designing the french tis of willing but yet they are not doing that though we are doing there making the frantic of willing for the system not example of a sustainable building air it requires you and marmont resource it requires he oeconomically soon huge man power we cannot make such buildings again and there is not much of you to let arian purpose a chase again the same thing you would do resources the required and that is why we see that devilling say carmel or this chap or am not talking about a structure like this but our condemned no dear structure these kinds of structures are not being constructed simply because they consume huge amount of resource and in turn in return they are not really utilitarian in nature however if you look at this example which is offer university one of the greatest universities in recorded history do it consumes huge moment resource it consumes huge economy roland it also consumed huge man for to construct it will it but it has a large utilitarian purpose because of which this kind of a building by purposes i mean and not saying by design i still suffering the seem more and more universities coming up why when they're not for one person there not for a select audience they are for on larger mass they are utilitarian in nature so they have coprolites we come down to the answer to a question what is it with talking about architect of what is it that the thing was a ten first which has lived and moment i impart anything which has lessened impact will often wore a seminar response which has larger in romelia second last resource from doing something which consumed you economically source
