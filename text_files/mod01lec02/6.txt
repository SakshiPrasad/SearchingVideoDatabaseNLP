not sultan of wood they were intensive where people alter outcome here anything white labor intensive if people on the outcome in terms of building or the porters of the billy may be sustained how we would if it is not all but people anything which is laboring tensive may not sustain and the last you till it aria in nature for every one if we are looking at perfessor the willing which is being constructed for a select few very few people a community of las typos people it will not be sustaining we will not see many of such billings coming in till it is not you tuition ignite so if i look at this discussion conclusion of the entire lecture discussion we know what kind of being sustained in the longer run many of you might have questions on the type of buildings which which are coming up highly resource intensive buildings for example saying five shooters which are highly resource consuming but you see that they there are not many fishergate which you would see there are fewer of them were if you of them because they are catering to a select class of people group of people they are not utilitarian in nature that lie it is not a very sisterly belding and health not many of binford however on the other hand to look at residence because it is fulfilling the most fundamental of the needs and it is more utilitarian you would see that more and more residences in the time to concombre but they will be required more and more so i will conclude this lecture by drawing the water line for so severe well of men of which sustainable architecture is a subside to receive that there is an wimen as bottom line anything that is all and in treatment not impeachment but that is actually taking a large portion of the environment is not sustainable then in which confuse the lesson amenable source will be sustainable anything better benefiting to the economy where economy flourishes all it doesn't take a large portion of the economy for a smile a purpose is sustainable and last it is useful for the society from its utility for pest as also from it cantillon text anything that is contextual culturally and has a larger utilitarian purpose is what will sustain if you look at any sample any wilding and that's a point wonderful look at any well link and tried to evaluate from any of these purposes you would see whether that building would sustain or not sustain if we look at some of the beautiful examples of huge hoary which were created an arbor of the country ragstone or a carlo come alard or where ever any one line which has been abandoned that is vile either of the bill creating life may not be meeting may not be whole in those cases we would very clearly see one of these being while lated over the time he de acutest has changed the social cicerone has changed or the building is not solving any utility it is it is not a utilitarian willing all it is intensive on economy we thought economical resort why in my mental resource intensive either of these three wood fail or being any development on the other has anything which feels this what a line will be seen as sustaining so i will close the second lecture by leaving the last slight with you and we would start our next lecture from her itself were to a wind i grant this is the most general definition of sustainable development which would be would find where this
