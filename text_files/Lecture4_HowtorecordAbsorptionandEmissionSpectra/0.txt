i sotavento our lap and we see how abortion and every sense spectrally recorded unfortunately we not be able to open up the mission for you but we try to give you an idea nevertheless so far as we call you the adoption and evesham pitiful mites and then will recur therefore you and explain along the way this is an absorption which of tomatoes you might remember from the previous lecture that it consists of a lamp so of light a dispersion element and the sleet which combined is called monochromatic and then you have the sample and the detector ah this is where the lands are in this particular pictorial if you can leave the and writing there there are two lamps dulminster in taunton land and tartarian lamp constantines visible raveling and together vide an evil it paling or you might be wondering what is the need of two lamps in the first place we need two lamps because constituent give an reviled and does he imason good for visible source but then we have to combine the efforts of the land that is done by using a middle a clipping bitter with when we walk in the visible dane reflects the output of the dentalium lane and casador of the dirty lumley and when we work in the otterville it does exactly opposite by singing to a different position so the light ponteland comes out well sweeter well as there's a monochrome so the colour gets elected then there's a beau peter which visited too and now as you see there a cool places that we could keep yourselves this is called the sample compartment this is called the reference compartment and like comes out to these two holes and goes to these two and finally directorates there these two directors record is iland i edipe tively and work out the observance so e since for using two detectors it is important that we corrector the responses and that is done by using what is called a besancon what i've done now is i have bought her the solvent in on board the side sample and reverence in principle i should get a horizontal prattling if e i reforestation ideas quality and louisiana it is but as you'll see when we try to record the spectrum will not get a stage line let us see contesting this lobster in mere cording the best line now first in to note is that it is not a orizontal sailing there is the cause the posts of the tool or fornicators and not exactly the same secondly as you see the spectre is being built a point by point that is because the rate was is the grating inside monica mater dotes of particular position then stops and then as long as gestation ally it masterman is done and the thing you might have noted is a small king that comes at around pioneers that is well beyond fioravante at longer raveling we used the alford of the constant land and a blue and red etienne used the output of the tartarian lamb so what happened there is that it orating with her tenison and reflex either the afford of dotted or output of tantallan depending on the thing so here we recorded the base line now it is a store in the system and we define it as the italian so in all subsequent miseries that we do here this was light is going to be subtracted from whatever we get and you'll get at a character absorption spectrum a last point to note here is a hot the grass looks like as we discussed in the pious lecture a spectrum is always as some resilient used it botians unbelieving except as her as some israelite excesses here is willing with is a mason of energy why ere is a sore that you discussed earlier and if you might remember a aristotle any unit at all all right now coming back is the best line so this ideally should have been flat it is not because of the difference in this sponsored
