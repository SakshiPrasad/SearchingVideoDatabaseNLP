the spectrum not the exceptive once again is in reality animates why as is now is interested in abiturient now it is a recent because the value that you get here depend on many things indifference on what kind of street use what is the lampin desire apricale day and so on or so for what is the absorbers of the sample so ah this value as sad a does have and does not have to much of home however it can be on water to a minuteful entity by doing a competitive study and working out the antonio this is a thing will not discuss in this course of weavers interested we go back to our discussion in the molecules spectroscope course and also referred to as the furious for you were very introduced it in a small way unless will back to the setter now what will do it we heap everything the same but we are going to change everlasting to one point five afore do that the result petronian let us lemember ah when the dangers of iowa e why axes we castrates and it is rather janet let us amember the shape of the faction now this may increase this to one point five second everything is the same excitation we into sam except excitation sleep with anastasia they don't dare as everything is sam we only think that a thing is averaging time which means the number of times you record at one particular point and a number of times you have as eisenstadt of seeing on a point for half a second now we are staying for one and a half second let us see how the space contains if we do that the started reporting you might see the small line coming up to what we see is it is more unlearning the spectrum that we are recorded earlier but the weenies we have made our slow so does the quality we come any better on and we come back to the question once we have a rich de maximum but ah ah what hast minepit on out here is that you see with it we are reporting lechaeum the same sample a few seconds after verticordia the first one and you can see that the not exactly well let bess why ah your duivenboden and take an average because there are many things that affect the acolyte intensity the hereford lassy if locateli it is a little less a jagged then what it was for the initial restaurant and even in the vestments it is not early as nice as it was so what we have here is that we have a sample that is not very highly amiss in such a case you have to use a longer integration time in fact even one point five second is obviously not enough or the special man you are to use something that is longer if you want to get a yearly good star let us do that now will he eat plaidie of patience and chance this profile so it is there is one great well point he five minutes to complete let us see with her investing this mite of time has any face on the singer occasion started with harding i can see something creeping up here what it is going to take some time so oh let us take a willisbeck and come back and show you the spiranthes it has been reported right so oh we have given it a several minutes and this is the special that we have got so far now you see will not be hottentots and because of what we think to me can be made with this date to be got from the first become second pesante rise to men if you go from the second spectatorial when we increase the indication time from one point five seconds
