now having saved this as best light we are going to record and absorption spectrum and see what it looks like we are the cording the spectrum now i was again you might not that the species will being with wine by point initially my thing that it is going down actually not the other values are very very small and now the actual absorption ben shows up that is the maximum for our sample with a tired about four hundred thirty one vigorous and if you now be waxes it is about one in a which means our sample is very very did you you can do an easy calculation assuring the excellent to have a value of prince hasan even calculate what kind of concentration it is using labored was to absorb any call to excellency and mix me sure you how could record and elisabet ram this is an ancient aspect of atomic so what it has inside is it has a lamp but destinies in on them which is once for powerful and has a emission over the entire revisable invaded reveling thing this is approximately when the lamp is this is where the monocrats and this is very deep the sample so the light comes from this direction it is focused at the centre of the cubic or there at will this glanville with typically deposit a glass of water is called the tube and as he said the last day enchanted at ninety degrees so that he acted his cap some on the other side and don't forget we are to uncreate and excitation a critter on this side and an arisian this say to start with we are going to keep our sample in here keep the excitation on a committer at a particular position and were the emission monocrats that way we are going to record and emson the emission spectrum little on will do us opposite and record an excitation spectrum this is our simple i am going to put it inside the tube or that and record the spectrum before we begin a prize have a look at the set of here the wives said we appeared now that the absorption is around for undred for unreturned so were exciting the samples puranapore enemies and we won to the cold the alien from four feet anatto six hundred ton either remember every shan usually asserted at longer willing unless it is an organ working with edie and the other important paritot are excitation arisen late and you will see that they are risen in tonometer so what wesleyans is the band was of the light that goes to act this waving so essentially we are saying that we are exciting with orange pretence that mines to point pitanatae we record then also we record at last mine went for us to quit five down and with her a kind of penguin and one now we are going to regard a i one hundred printanier were minute and ill using and aveline of half a second requesting this and will see how that effect on spectrum the last one is this interval we have at one man with his his stallion or you will is able then but if we quite you can an it so this is our state and now vittorio and enchanted ram you can see the spectrum building lie here initially the intensity is very less salzman little wit ye now you can see the spectrum forming and once again it is forming point by point each point correspond to the particular position of the amienois and as he waited he say well isopelis do really good cause i done very quickly the indication kind the false is only about half a second sir find so after this we are going to go back to the set up and we can and we tried to see with her is any improvement in the quality of the spectrum but
