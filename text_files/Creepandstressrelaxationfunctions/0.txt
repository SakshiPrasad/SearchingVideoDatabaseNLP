in the long three back to another lecture on a introduction to soft matters so last time what we were discussing were the idea of sleep and at the crippledom nan and the stress lies in eromena and what we saw was that if you are an experiment isyogo to the lab and your doing to experience you'll probably end up with a different people who if i the go to the lab the land up at different creep casan this family of course is what represents the meter property don't and then if you similarly do a saturniens for the stress exists like in phenomena the elevates a set of cars which are again representing some genocide property so this is very interesting and very helpful but we won't do ask that question just like in previous intolerance or you might have seen that the is single cove with in the present tersest so we won't ask that same question all over again is that can we simplify the situation we little bit and can we not with a system where we can define the medlar properties by a single goatherd and a family of course so here there is a important of that is to be important that that is a consequent lineality so as we are going to introduce this concept and the sea so so i'm just going to say that before that what we do is to so so idea of lineality involves two concepts skip one is the idea are seeds is thy dear lines calling and on the other is another is called the superposition of responses responds this pansies this do ideas are differentes so let us first take up thy ideally mescal so first we let a this problem the idea of a esop we ended up so we have this function which is a function of two variables right time and stress so the question well ask you is canorous this to unchallenged radio so here as the proposition of lineage is the proposition of lineuil is that when you martia the stress import by a factor of alphaeus sisseton madelaine factor then your response ganges proportionally so i do have a tin happening is that it should become an for tinsel she ties so is this so by the is is a proposition this need not hold true that i we are saying that it is a proposition so if this horse so if so if the proposition is true
