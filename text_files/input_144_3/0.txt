i class so to day all be talking about climate change and species responses to climate change and were all be shown you to day is what we can learn from the geological record in terms understanding pass fanatic events now species responded to those climatic events all right so the first context here in his cane you electricity itself which i'm not going to go into right now is a point that the world is warming and a human torsonse for it this been a law debate about this in the public media that i gain what hit the point that scientists are unified in a man that evidence is overwhelming at this point that the world is warming in human are sponsible so you look you look at the plot there you can sit a black line which shows historical observations of global mean temperatures over the last century you considers been about a seven tessier warming now if you look to the future which is those various blue lines you can see that the various models projects an acceleration of these warming trends over this century and depending on the scenario look at from blue to red there began anywhere from but a tottering to but a forebearing now he can nor that yellow red line of the bottom there that's more a one of scenery if we weren't to do the priest down hot and other greenhouse gassion the mediately what happened to climates and which is clearly knocking to happen any time soon so the point being that were facing a teterree warming over the century and a question that being what will happen how ill fiscal systems respond to a hurricane frequency flood frequency how will species and natural consistence response and how our own societies responded i take this drastic changes in climate so one place we can learn to look to the fire an ter these sort of questions is looking to the last twenty thousand years a pill if you look at that map of its top which you can see there is that twenty thousand years ago we had a large ice sheet on top of the northern hemisphere covering much of north america and the rest of northern hemisphere contract with a map and right there which shows an ice which is more the present day state i speak and my men to greenland we've gone from a glacial state to an irrigatin state in a span of a twenty thousand years that red carven thought him those that we've gone from a butter tendered change in greenland is in this temperature record from reeling we go from about at left twenty thousand years ago to write present day in a fessel abrupt warming and cooling along the wages abrupt transitional events and to have a very good delagoa record an understanding of the climatic change the past as now i look at the ecologists is to those connecticut so what does some of the things we can pull out from a sort of sort of data or we look at fossil paul and other plant records one of the things we can see is as species are highly dynamic as climate changes species migrate it is you can see the here where you can see the top there you can it's the left hand panel is for twenty one thousand years ago going to the right at present and i can see ice melts away as go from matama there but they look at the green which is a distresses based upon fossil poland other fossil plants records i could see the distress changed from being malignant us to oberos candid or the span of his twenty thousand years so ranges a highly dynamic now of course trees aren't taking up and moving than at walking from point of point be but instead there dispersing seeds on these seas established a new areas they can call nientes new populations and in other areas were with spruce used to grow those are is become unfavorable in those populations die off that's owes range ships of these species now a piece of good news majolica record is that we don't have very many observing tensions of plants of the last twenty thousand years plastics i should stand what example where we do is shown here in this diagram this is a some cross sections of some spruces there as the first four eight though the air from it from a still living species of spruce eager from extinct dishes of spruce and we so either some clear evidence from fossil records the laelia that as a satisfactum grew in the path it or not dounia so species do go extinct but bismarckian in the rule however if you combine climate change with other drivers other stresses to these natural systems that's what you can have widespread and potentially devastating of ways extinctions the most famous one occurrin to an end of the place to see in here with the extinction of madness and other large mammals from north america these were caused by the concomitant of climate change with human hunting renatus clinical i killed the man this wasn't as human hunting alone killed the males by his was a commision together that was so so deadly so on the clear lessons for to day is that as he go to the in his twenty per century it's a commision of climate change with human land use which changes it to nutrients slices with a basis spaces being moved from content etonnent that in a post a true risks to species at present the last point i want to hit is is the
