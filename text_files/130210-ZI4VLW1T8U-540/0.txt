so big and am so last class as we thought about solving a system as i was by using a technique called gaienthon what we did here was to go from this system using a set of elementary operations right to a system that looked like this right so this was the process sir we saw last last last lecture a isaaco of example asked her how this is sir done and practiced now we also saw that this may reckon opper trying marian see is the modified right hand side hollow is a key point right now you had to do a saporito not just on the less assertion as a lie the same set of operations to the right in so of the equation as well right so the thing is leaner as you brag is as full of twists and surprises like the acquaint entrance movie i would say calculus is more like twilight where you know what sir onhappy but you just have no idea how to get there right ah but ministries full as surprises and if it don't out that this party clear atherton ah which we saw as the situations on the equations can be very elegantly reformulated in terms of matrices right now the whole point is inserting through these operations one by one can be right down the entire alverton in terms of matrices and rectors okay it turns out it is possible and that's first orris okay and a process by which shall we represent goemon are using mathesis is called el decomposition it it's like a gangsters doing me osiris a widow with the matrice eye eliminated it and alagoas a did it decompose properly yes probably sororities in names for these odors but let you what the arearea now what we want to do as we would like to write a as the product of two matrosses ellen you right and we will see that this has a correspondence with the galinazo albert and that we saw last last lecture okay now this here is sainte as i made resolvability what would you guess that to be a lord trying the mitre right so all will be a lower trying with me tricks and is you here is going to be an opportunitie and interestingly you will see that the youth from gallinato will reappear in the process now why do you want to do this not if you look at this and this step is there the right an i be in wall in the equation to right now the only pronation i sit was presenteth you had to take care of the right and soester not in many problems of her interest in initialing nerig your matrix represents the mole right and the right hand side will represent erinaceus for example you can have a structure with the specific number of elements and the righthandiron diraient the forces on the fructuous want to check welhaven if i change the serferez for the same wadleigh latens the right insides going to change if you did gushington as we did before you have to go through the same operation again and again right you have to do it for a new reinstate this allusions ition is ready elegant are you an have to bother about the rinsin right just take care of the matrix
