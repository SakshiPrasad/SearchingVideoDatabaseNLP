in the long to come again to the course an irruption to soft matter you discussing last time two behaviours to important phenomena that we had discovered which is the deep phenomena mistress relaxation phenomenon so the isquay go back to that so what we had seen and this is a combined grapho all of them all the three important behaviours that we had discussed so we shall be found that when you are blaines to a system the three two classical mates a solid in the classical is of fluid the behave the friendly and the wisconsin was his somewhere in between the two and we had said that this particular cow the agoing to denote this as she deems signal so that the creolian is a ponchartrain variable time and the stress applied here you you can even editors simiot in general domsie sigma is so this is a creep and in the next one the stress relaxation enon we introduced ourselves to one more to other phenomena which were we said we are applying an ornamental strain and then the stress deceases over time so this curve was given the name g or was denoted as g tecoma absent so once again i chose you that it is a function of two way the import variables time and and then on a motor straining post so we are going to look at this in a little bit of more detail as this one more thing so for to make sure of the system is so the strain here is being applied at time peculiar we are going to do is we wind defined as functions as that we know that this function is equal to zero for the less than i so this one time becomes well defined and similarly for the other case we are going to say that an imposition that this function be selford times lessons is curing it of his all the experiments of beginning it seoritas origin so then we have a continuation we will be it will reintegrate before others important calculation it so ah what we had started off with where these different tests like we are irish of the first discussion of the first tree and now we wanted this castoon which is a different effect of different histories so let as do that so here we want to know a discussion on affected history before we do that it is a ejus quick like what we have or elastic solid we did a number of different strain control in the stress controled tests and what i found out that the generic gal if you were to blot the stress was strained look something like this very raicharan and then am now this gas does not depend on the history by which you and i at this situation which means it doesn't matter how you could like experiment you or how you imposed what values are stresses that you chose or what anisette straine trainante wataitee that we chose you always end up that this craft but that doesn't happen any more for this glastic fruit a wislac maderia so this was your designer response
