of the solid whatso down let us if we wanted by one needed would we should do is let us have the mission where your applying an anamoo stress this is time is this is time this is stress this tenancies and then you have you can either do it this way or you go to a different parts different parts to live that so let us call this part one is his part to missus part three what we see when we do these experiments is to go to be recording the strain with time and what are you see is that in this case so let us say this is a response to part one the pontipette can end up at a different location and here your part three can in up at a different location all together these not the consequence of these grave this is let's say you get a for an experiment so here at haddon time were you ended or some teach all the three experimental the parts has the same stress but on this case you do not have that you end up with different values astrain and his different times so when you gather made when you plead a crash and you o stress was the strain when you find is the responsions in the first what you this will be this is what it might look like the second part and then i ethiops for escalate materials you no longer have unique sigma selenites and this is where histrionics insofar you don't know the apostate the escalante die you must know now the part by which it had come there because it is no longer enough for you to prairer anybody else to provide an instant indians value and then demand an instant the value of the instant if of the response that time because the response had that a time t dependeth on the pleiads and if you remember no first let jessie discussing how time becomes an explicit palamit but for classical visaige and classical elastic made solid sarcastical his cusswords and classical elastic solids do time is an important paramita and that's how you are conducting the experiment it hid somewhere although should have been an a parliament at that was there but
